EXTRACTION RULES:

1. STRUCTURED ATTRIBUTES: For each field, find the EXACT text from the RFP that matches the attribute type. Copy the complete relevant sentence/paragraph. If not found, use "Not specified".

2. REQUIREMENTS: Find EVERY requirement in the text. Look for these patterns:
   - "shall" (contractor shall, offeror shall, offerors shall)
   - "must"
   - "will" (when indicating requirement)
   - "required"
   - "mandatory"
   - Any other clear requirement language

   For each requirement:
   - rfp_ref: "SECTION.SUBSECTION / Page XX"
   - section: The section name (A, B, C, etc.)
   - req_id: Sequential like A001, A002, L001, L002, etc.
   - description: The COMPLETE exact sentence/paragraph containing the requirement
   - sub_factors: Any sub-requirements within that paragraph
   - compliance_type: "mandatory", "desirable", or "informational"
   - snippet: Same as description

3. CRITICAL SUMMARY: Identify 3-5 top themes from the requirements, with their importance level and key requirement IDs.

4. SEARCH THE ENTIRE TEXT - do not miss sections or pages.

5. Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanations, no markdown, no additional text.
