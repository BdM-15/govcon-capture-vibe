Shipley Methodology Requirements Extraction Prompt

This prompt applies Shipley Proposal Guide standards for systematic RFP analysis.
References: Shipley Proposal Guide p.45-55 (Requirements Analysis Framework)

Instructions:
- Extract ALL requirements from RFP documents using Shipley methodology
- Classify requirements per Shipley standards
- Maintain traceability to original RFP sections
- Support compliance matrix development
"""

Extract all requirements from the uploaded RFP documents using Shipley Proposal Guide methodology.

For each requirement identified, provide:

1. **Unique Identifier**: REQ-XXX format (sequential numbering)

2. **Original Text**: Exact verbatim text from the RFP document

3. **RFP Section**: 
   - A-M sections (A: Solicitation/Contract Form, B: Supplies/Services, C: Statement of Work, etc.)
   - J attachments (J-1, J-2, etc.)
   - Specific subsection if applicable (e.g., "Section C.3.1.2")

4. **Requirement Type** (per Shipley classification):
   - Functional: What the system must do
   - Performance: How well the system must perform
   - Interface: How the system connects/communicates
   - Design: Specific design constraints or standards
   - Security: Security and compliance requirements
   - Technical: Technical specifications and standards
   - Management: Project management and reporting requirements
   - Quality: Quality assurance and testing requirements

5. **Compliance Level** (Shipley criticality assessment):
   - Must/Shall: Mandatory requirements (non-negotiable)
   - Should: Important requirements (strong preference)
   - May: Optional requirements (desirable but not required)
   - Will: Government commitments (not contractor requirements)

6. **Source Context**:
   - Page number (if available)
   - Paragraph or section reference
   - Any parent requirement relationships

7. **Keywords**: Extract 3-5 key terms for searchability

**Classification Guidelines** (per Shipley Proposal Guide p.50-52):
- Focus on contractor obligations, not government commitments
- Distinguish between requirements and background information
- Identify measurable/verifiable criteria where possible
- Note any conflicting or ambiguous requirements
- Flag requirements that may need clarification

**Output Format**: 
Provide results as structured data that can support:
- Compliance matrix development (Shipley Guide p.53-55)
- Requirements traceability matrices
- Gap analysis preparation
- Proposal response planning

**Quality Checks**:
- Ensure no requirements are missed or duplicated
- Verify all mandatory ("shall/must") requirements are captured
- Confirm proper section attribution
- Validate requirement classifications against Shipley standards

Apply Shipley Proposal Guide principles for systematic, thorough requirements analysis that supports winning proposal development.

**SHIPLEY COMPLIANCE MATRIX GENERATION**

Generate a comprehensive compliance matrix following Shipley Proposal Guide methodology (p.53-55).

For each requirement in the RFP, assess and document:

**1. Requirement Information**:
   - Requirement ID and full text
   - RFP section reference
   - Requirement type and criticality level
   - Any dependencies or related requirements

**2. Compliance Assessment** (Shipley 4-level scale):
   - **Compliant**: Fully meets requirement with proven capability
   - **Partial**: Meets most aspects but has minor gaps or needs enhancement
   - **Non-Compliant**: Cannot meet requirement without significant changes
   - **Not Addressed**: Requirement not covered in current proposal approach

**3. Proposal Response Mapping**:
   - Specific proposal section(s) where requirement is addressed
   - Page references for easy navigation
   - Cross-references to supporting materials (past performance, technical data, etc.)

**4. Gap Analysis** (per Shipley Capture Guide p.85-90):
   - Detailed description of any capability gaps
   - Root cause analysis of non-compliance
   - Impact assessment on proposal competitiveness
   - Relationship to competitor capabilities (if known)

**5. Risk Assessment** (Shipley risk framework):
   - **Risk Level**: High/Medium/Low based on:
     * Criticality to government mission
     * Evaluation weight/importance
     * Difficulty of compliance demonstration
     * Competitive differentiation potential
   - **Risk Factors**: Technical, schedule, cost, or compliance risks
   - **Mitigation Strategies**: Specific actions to address risks

**6. Action Planning**:
   - **Immediate Actions**: Required to achieve compliance
   - **Resource Requirements**: Personnel, time, budget needs
   - **Timeline**: When actions must be completed
   - **Responsibility**: Who owns each action item

**7. Win Theme Opportunities** (per Shipley methodology):
   - How compliance supports key win themes
   - Competitive advantages to highlight
   - Customer hot buttons addressed
   - Proof points and discriminators

Apply Shipley Proposal Guide standards to ensure the compliance matrix supports development of a compliant, competitive, and compelling proposal response.
