In addition, the Government will \nestablish title and ownership in all property acquired and/or utilized by the Contractor in the performance of the contract as \nprovided for in FAR 52.245-1. Pursuant to FAR 52.245-1(e)(2), this narrative establishes specific requirements for passage \nof title, wherein title to property acquired, fabricated, or utilized by the Contractor for use on fixed-price contracts or fixed-\nprice line items will vest with the Government, rather than be retained by the Contractor. This requirement for passage of \ntitle to the Government for property acquired and/or utilized by the Contractor under fixed-price efforts applies to \nacquisitions under the contract resulting from solicitation W59TC-25-R-A005, as well as third-party contracts authorized by \nthe Government under the contract. The requirement for Government title includes, but is not limited to, plant equipment \nrequired to maintain capabilities to demilitarize items for the Government at Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD). The \nGovernment will retain title and ownership of all personal property that is maintained, upgraded, replaced, or added, as \nnecessary, to sustain existing, new, or additional capabilities as may be determined by the Government throughout the life \nof the contract. No separate funding will be provided, except in the case of direct funded PWSs. Title to any property, \nincluding special tooling and test equipment, will vest to the Government in accordance with FAR 52.245-1, the \nGovernment Property PWS, and the provisions of this narrative, whether provided or acquired and/or utilized under fixed-\npriced, or cost-reimbursable contract efforts, and whether as a direct, or indirect cost item. In clarification, this provision \napplies only to the Contractor and does not apply to the property of Contractor's subcontractors or Armament, Retooling, \nand Manufacturing Support (ARMS) tenants, unless that property was purchased with ARMS funds or is part of the Army's \ncapacity; it does not apply to the Contractor's property acquired or used solely for commercial production unless that \nproperty is part of the Army's capacity. Commercial Production includes any business activity not undertaken pursuant to \nthe performance of the production, facility, or third-party contracts. For property acquired and/or utilized by the Contractor \nunder fixed-price efforts, where absent the provisions of this narrative, title would have vested in the Contractor, title will \nvest with the Government at the end of the final contract performance period, whether or not the",

The Contractor shall provide a \nTransferable Property List of all tagged property acquired in performance of the contract, including investment projects, \nwherein title is vested with the Contractor until transfer to the Government at the end of the contract, as outlined herein and \nin accordance with the Transferable Property List.\nH.1.2 Technical Data Rights:\na. Through the contract resulting from solicitation W519TC-25-R-A005, the Government will establish rights in all \ntechnical data required or used to demilitarize munitions at HWAD, as well as operate and maintain HWAD, including the \nprocesses and procedures used to maintain those capabilities as determined by the Government throughout the life of the \ncontract; as well as technical data used in the performance of prime and third-party contracts. The Contractor will ensure \nthat the Government obtains right to intellectual property (IP) regardless of the source (i.e., IP obtained from a public \ndomain, purchased/licensed from the incumbent/a previous operator, or developed at private expense).

Technical data rights for non-commercial software and software applications encompass, but are not limited to, system \ndesign and architecture, program source code, interfaces, and associated system and user documentation. Data rights for \ncommercial off the shelf (COTS) software applications encompass features of tailoring necessary for software \nimplementation/functionality at HWAD, including but not limited to customized scripts, database parameters, screens, \nreports, interfaces, and user documentation.W519TC25RA005Page 23 of 86\nc. Technical data rights in software and software applications include all features necessary to enable a successor to \ncontinue to use, maintain, or modify the software systems in place should the successor choose to use the same non-\ncommercial software and/or license the same COTS software. While technical data rights are established by Defense \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (DFARS) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data - Other Than Commercial Products and \nCommercial Services, and DFARS 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than \nCommercial Computer Software Documentation, the Government requires, as a result of this contract, nothing less than \nGovernment purpose rights in technical data as defined by DFARS 252.227-7013, DFARS 252.227-7014, and this \nnarrative. Accordingly, irrespective of the source of funds, the Contractor grants nothing less than Government purpose \nrights in all technical data used in the execution of any contract awarded under solicitation W519TC-25-R-A005, as well as \nthird-party contracts under the contract. In clarification, this grant (of nothing less than Government purpose rights) applies \nonly to the technical data of the Contractor; it does not apply to the technical data of the Contractor's subcontractors or \nARMS tenants, or technical data associated solely with commercial demilitarization, with the exception of technical data of \na subcontractor(s) or ARMS tenant(s) used to operate and/or maintain Government property, modifications to Government \nproperty, or property whose title to will vest with the Government under the provisions of the preceding paragraph. In these \ninstances, the Government will receive no less than Government purpose rights to that technical data. No separate funding \nwill be provided for these rights in technical data. Any costs associated with the rights granted to the Government must be \nincluded in the unit prices proposed. Additionally, the Government will receive Unlimited Rights to all technical data \ndeveloped as a result of direct funded modernization or other projects, to include any technical data created or developed as \na result of integrating modernization projects at the Depot, and/or technical data developed to operate modernized \nequipment and facilities and the procedures to produce product on modernized equipment and facilities. Unless otherwise \napproved, in advance by the Procuring Contracting Officer, the Government shall receive Government purpose rights at that \npoint in time when the technical data is implemented in performance of this contract and/or third-party contracts.

This authority allows for shutdown of a suspect operation or practice prior to the elimination of the \nperceived danger through regular channels. This includes an immediate shutdown in those situations in which the Depot \nCommander or Commander's Representative determines that an activity presents an imminent hazard to life or property that \nthreatens the mission of the Government. This authority does not contravene the provisions of Authority of Government \nRepresentative included in Section I.\nH.3 CONGRESSIONAL VISITS\nH.3.1 Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated installations must comply with Army Regulation (AR) 1-20. Therefore, the \nContractor shall forward any requests for visits by Members of Congress to the Depot Commander or Commander's \nRepresentative for approval.

If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor shall share in net acquisition savings according to the percentages shown in the table below. \nThe percentage paid the Contractor depends upon-\n(1) This contract's type (fixed-price, incentive, or cost-reimbursement);\n(2) The sharing arrangement specified in paragraph (a) of this clause (incentive, program requirement, or a combination as delineated in the \nSchedule); and\n(3) The source of the savings (the instant contract, or concurrent and future contracts), as follows:\n          \n                 Contractor's Share of Net Acquisition Savings (Figure in Percent)    \n                 Contract Type                 Incentive (Voluntary)                 Program Requirement (Mandatory)  \n                                  Instant Contract Rate                 Concurrent and Future Contract Rate                 Instant Contract Rate                 Concurrent and \nFuture Contract Rate  \n                 Fixed-price (includes fixed-price-award-fee; excludes other fixed-price incentive contracts)                 *50                 *50                 \n25                 25  \n                 Incentive (fixed-price or cost) (other than award fee)                 (**)                 *50                 (**)                 25  \n                 Cost-reimbursement (includes cost-plus-award-fee; excludes other cost-type incentive contracts)                 ***25                 \n***25                 15                 15  \n                 * The Contracting Office may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 75 percent for each VECP.  \n                 ** Same sharing arrangement as the contract's profit or fee adjustment formula.  \n                 *** The Contracting Office may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 50 percent for each VECP.  \n(g) Calculating net acquisition savings.\n(1) Acquisition savings are realized when (i) the cost or price is reduced on the instant contract, (ii) reductions are negotiated in concurrent contracts, \n(iii) future contracts are awarded, or (iv) agreement is reached on a lump-sum payment for future contract savings (see paragraph (i)(4) of this clause). \nNet acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid a share, when Government costs and any negative instant contract savings \nhave been fully offset against acquisition savings.\n(2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be offset \nagainst acquisition savings each time such savings are realized until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated by multiplying net \nacquisition savings by the appropriate Contractor's percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) of this clause). Additional Contractor shares of net \nacquisition savings shall be paid to the Contractor at the time realized.\n(3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent and future \ncontract savings. The Contractor shall share through the contract incentive structure in savings on the instant contract items affected. Any negative \ninstant contract savings shall be added to the target cost or to the target price and ceiling price, and the amount shall be offset against concurrent and \nfuture contract savings.\n(4) If the Government does not receive and accept all items on which it paid the Contractor's share, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for \nthe proportionate share of these payments.\n(h) Contract adjustment. The modification accepting the VECP (or a subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any negotiations are \ncompleted) shall-\n(1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract;\n(2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, increase the contract price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated",

For incentive contracts, shares shall be added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on the instant contract. The \nContractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract.\n(2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of concurrent contract savings by-\n(i) Subtracting from the reduction in price negotiated on the concurrent contract any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet \noffset; and\n(ii) Multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.\n(3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of future contract savings by-\n(i) Multiplying the future unit cost reduction by the number of future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period;\n(ii) Subtracting any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset; and\n(iii) Multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.\n(4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single lump sum rather \nthan in a series of payments over time as future contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future contract savings may be calculated \nwhen the VECP is accepted, on the basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that will be delivered during the sharing period. \nThe Contractor's share shall be included in a modification to this contract (see paragraph (h)(3) of this clause) and shall not be subject to subsequent \nadjustment.\n(5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with section 48.104-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Government \nand the Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost settlement method, the following applies:\n(i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract and on its concurrent contracts only.\n(ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future contracts, and all \ncollateral savings.\n(j) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this \nclause, by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a \ntypical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed \nthe contract's firm-fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The \nContracting Officer will be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.\n(k) Relationship to other incentives. Only those benefits of an accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost (production unit cost, \noperating and support costs, reliability and maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this clause. However, the targets of such \nincentives affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to \nsurpass them, the value engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target.\n(l) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract-valued at or above the simplified acquisition \nthreshold, as defined in FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any \nadjustment in this contract's price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable development and \nimplementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive \npayments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract. The Contractor may choose any \narrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments, provided, that the payments shall not reduce the Government's share of \nconcurrent or future contract savings or collateral savings.\n(m) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on \nthe affected parts:\nThese data, furnished under the Value Engineering clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, used, or \ndisclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause.

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a provision may be accessed \nelectronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/.\nIf the provision requires additional or unique information, then that information is provided immediately after the provision title.\nM.1 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS \nM.1.1 The Government will review the Offeror's proposal for compliance with Section L. Any deviations or non-compliances \ndiscovered in the compliance review may results in the proposal being rejected. Any proposal information that does not comply \nwith Section L requirements (e.g., extra pages or non-complaint text) will be removed or redacted, as appropriate, and will not \nbe evaluated. \nM.1.2 The Government reserves the right to make no award if it is in the best interest of the Government. The Government \nreserves the right to not make an award at a price premium that it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the \nevaluated superiority of one proposal over another. The Government also reserves the right to make no award should no \nproposal prove to be Acceptable or better based on the criteria set forth in the Solicitation. \nM.1.3 The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance \nwill include areas not specified in the Offeror's proposal. \nM.1.4 The Offeror's proposal should contain its best terms. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract \nafter conducting discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to award without conducting discussions if it is \ndetermined to be in the Government's best interest. Discussions will only be held with Offerors whose proposals are within the \ncompetitive range. If the Procuring Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the \ncompetitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Procuring Contracting Officer \nmay limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition \namong the most highly rated proposals.\nM.1.5 An Offeror's submittal of unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, for even a single Technical Experience evaluation \ncriterion, may result in the Government determining that the Offeror's proposed Self-Rated Score is disingenuous and/or \nartificially inflated. This disingenuous or artificially inflated score may result in the Government determining the Offerors \nproposal to be disqualified and not awardable. The Government may unilaterally downward adjust the Offeror's score, \npotentially down to zero points.\nM.1.6 The Government will evaluate proposals using a two-phase approach. In the first phase, the Government will validate the \nSelf-Rated Scores to determine a Validated-Rated Score using the Offeror's Self-Scoring Matrix and Work Samples with \nincluded Project References. If the Validated-Rated Score, is above the minimum threshold of 60,000 out of 80,000 for Factors \n1.1-1.4, the Government will notify the Offeror that they shall submit the information requested in Section L for Factors 2.1-2.4 \nno later than 0900 central 20 days after notification. If the Validated-Rated Score, is below the minimum threshold of 60,000 for \nFactors 1.1-1.4, the Government will notify the Offeror that their proposal will not be given further consideration, and they will \nbe removed from the competition. The Government reserves the right to ask Offerors to clarify information included in Offeror's \nWork Sample submissions for the Phase I Self-Scoring Matrix. In the second phase, the Government will evaluate Offeror's \nFactors 2.1-2.4 in accordance with Section M. The Government will conduct a best value trade-off evaluation with Factors 2.1-\n2.4 in accordance with the processes outlined in Section M.3. The Government intends to award after discussions with Offerors \nwho qualify to participate in Phase II. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions if it is in the best interest \nof the Government. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.\nM.2 PHASE I \nM.2.1 PHASE I INSTRUCTIONS \nM.2.1.1 The Government will perform a compliance check for all submitted information required to be considered eligible for \naward. Non-compliant proposals are proposals that are inconsistent with Section L. Non-compliant proposals may not be further \nevaluated. Only Offerors whose proposals are determined to be compliant will move into the evaluation process. \nM.2.1.2 The Government will validate the Self-Rated Scores of each Factor. To do this, the Government will use the Self-\nScoring Matrix and Work Samples with Project References provided by the Offeror. If the Government is unable to find the W519TC25RA005Page 80 of 86\nsubstantiating information within the referenced page, paragraph, table, etc., the Government will not search further for the \nsubstantiating information. If the Government is unable to validate that Offeror's Self-Rated Score based on the Work Samples \nprovided, the Government will unilaterally downward adjust the Offeror's Self-Rated Score, potentially down to zero points. The \nGovernment will only adjust the Offeror's Self-Rated Score downward, not upward. Such adjustments are within the sole \ndiscretion of the Government and are based upon",

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 2.1, \"Best \nvalue means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in \nresponse to the requirement.\" The Government intends to award one contract to a single Offeror as a result of this Solicitation. \nM.3.1.2 Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Government. The relative \norder of importance assigned to the evaluation factors are: \nM.3.1.2.1 The Maintenance Factor is the most important factor and is more important than the following two equally important \nfactors (Demil and Innovation/Business Development). \nM.3.1.2.2 The Demil and Innovation/Business Development Factors are equally important. \nM.3.1.2.3 The Demil and Innovation/Business Development Factors are more important than the Price Factor. \nM.3.1.2.4 All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. \nM.3.1.3 To receive consideration for award, the Offeror must receive a rating of no less than Acceptable for the Maintenance, \nDemil, and Innovation/Business Development Factors. Offerors will be cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to W519TC25RA005Page 81 of 86\nthe lowest price offered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to a higher priced proposal if the Government \ndetermines that the Offeror's proposal provides the best value to the Government. If the non-price factors are evaluated as \ncomparatively equal between two or more Offerors, price may become a more important factor in the selection for award.\nM.3.1.4 Rating Definitions: The following definitions will be used in the evaluation and in conjunction with the ratings provided \nbelow.\nM.3.1.4.1 Significant Strength - An aspect of an Offeror's proposal with appreciable merit or will exceed specified performance \nor capability requirements to the considerable advantage of the Government during contract performance.\nM.3.1.4.2 Strength - An aspect of an Offeror's proposal with merit or will exceed specified performance or capability \nrequirements to the advantage of the Government during contract performance.\nM.3.1.4.3 Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. \nM.3.1.4.4 Significant Weakness - A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. \nM.3.1.4.5 Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant \nweaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. \nM.3.1.4.6 Uncertainty - Any aspect of a non-cost/price factor proposal for which the intent of the offer is unclear (e.g., more \nthan one way to interpret the offer or inconsistencies",

The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3.

Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

There are three aspects of the past performance \nevaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. The first is to evaluate the recency of the offeror's past performance. The second aspect is to determine the \nrelevancy of the offeror's past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\nN6945025R0003(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv).
