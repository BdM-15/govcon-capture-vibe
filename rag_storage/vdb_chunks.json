To access WAWF, the Contractor shall- \n (1) Have a designated electronic business point of contact in the System for Award Management at https://www.sam.gov; and \n (2) Be registered to use WAWF at https://wawf.eb.mil/ following the step-by-step procedures for self-registration available at this web site. \n (d) WAWF training. The Contractor should follow the training instructions of the WAWF Web-Based Training Course and use the Practice Training \nSite before submitting payment requests through WAWF. Both can be accessed by selecting the \"Web Based Training\" link on the WAWF home \npage at https://wawf.eb.mil/ \n (e) WAWF methods of document submission. Document submissions may be via web entry, Electronic Data Interchange, or File Transfer Protocol. \n (f) WAWF payment instructions.

this section, within 60 days after settlement of final indirect cost rates.\n(3) The Contractor and the appropriate Government representative shall execute a written understanding setting forth the final indirect cost rates. The \nunderstanding shall specify (i) the agreed-upon final annual indirect cost rates, (ii) the bases to which the rates apply, (iii) the periods for which the \nrates apply, (iv) any specific indirect cost items treated as direct costs in the settlement, and (v) the affected contract and/or subcontract, identifying \nany with advance agreements or special terms and the applicable rates.

As used in this clause-\nLong-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed \nfive years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at \n52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.\nSmall business concern-\n(1) Means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field of operation, and qualified as a small \nbusiness under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (d) of this clause.\n(2) Affiliates, as used in this definition, means business concerns, one of whom directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the others, or \na third party or parties control or have the power to control the others. In determining whether affiliation exists, consideration is given to all \nappropriate factors including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. SBA determines affiliation based on the \nfactors set forth at 13 CFR 121.103.\n(b) If the Contractor represented that it was any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) prior to award of this contract, the Contractor \nshall rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph (f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, upon \noccurrence of any of the following:W519TC25RA005Page 36 of 86\n(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation \nagreement was executed prior to inclusion of", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e2104eaeb1d56ffb1f043ce8101a9d5", "file_path": "Draft+Solicitation+W519TC-25-R-A005+.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-254b1008ea70c5d404e0dbb7add90654", "__created_at__": 1759242018, "content": "this contract, the Contractor \nshall rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph (f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, upon \noccurrence of any of the following:W519TC25RA005Page 36 of 86\n(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation \nagreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.\n(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this \nclause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.\n(3) For long-term contracts-\n(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract;

On an instant contract, future contract savings include savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to contract \nmodifications, exercise of options, additional orders, and funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.\nCollateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected collateral \ncosts, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes.\nContracting office includes any contracting office that the acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or another agency's office \nthat is performing a joint acquisition action.\nContractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e2104eaeb1d56ffb1f043ce8101a9d5", "file_path": "Draft+Solicitation+W519TC-25-R-A005+.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-d2d8d40270a3bbd784a863a1d87321e8", "__created_at__": 1759242018, "content": "subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.\nCollateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected collateral \ncosts, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes.\nContracting office includes any contracting office that the acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or another agency's office \nthat is performing a joint acquisition action.\nContractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in \ndeveloping, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by \nGovernment acceptance of a VECP.\nFuture unit cost reduction, as used in this clause, means the instant unit cost reduction adjusted as the Contracting Officer considers necessary for \nprojected learning or changes in quantity during the sharing period. It is calculated at the time the VECP is accepted and applies either-\n(1) Throughout the sharing period, unless the Contracting Officer decides that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly different \nfrom those previously anticipated; or\n(2) To the calculation of a lump-sum payment, which cannot later be revised.\nGovernment costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net W519TC25RA005Page 51 of 86\nincreases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistics support. The term does not include the normal administrative costs of \nprocessing the VECP or any increase in this contract's cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings.\nInstant contract, as used in this clause, means this contract, under which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after \nacceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If this is a multiyear contract, the term does \nnot include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers \nto the period for which firm prices have been established.\nInstant unit cost reduction means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any Contractor's development or \nimplementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on this, the instant contract. If this is a service contract, the instant unit cost reduction is \nnormally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on this contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.\nNegative instant contract savings means the increase in the cost or price of this contract when the acceptance of a VECP results in an excess of the \nContractor's allowable development and implementation costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant \ncontract units affected.\nNet acquisition savings means total acquisition savings, including instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.\nSharing base, as used in this clause, means the number of affected end items on contracts of the contracting office accepting the VECP.\nSharing period, as used in this clause, means the period beginning with acceptance of the first unit incorporating the VECP and ending at a calendar \ndate or event determined by the contracting officer for each VECP.\nUnit, as used in this clause, means the item or task to which the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree the VECP applies.\nValue engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that-\n(1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; and\n(2) Results in reducing the overall projected cost to the agency without impairing essential functions or characteristics;provided, that it does not \ninvolve a change-\n(i) In deliverable end item quantities only;\n(ii) In research and development (R&D) end items or R&D test quantities that is due solely to results of previous testing under this contract; or\n(iii) To the contract type only.\n(c) VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in each VECP the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this \nclause. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in those \nprocedures relating to format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern VECP preparation.

The cost reduction associated \nwith the VECP shall take into account the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including any amount attributable to \nsubcontracts under the Subcontracts paragraph of this clause.\n(5) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and support \ncosts.\n(6) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the agency.\n(7) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, \nnoting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.\n(8) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous \nGovernment", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e2104eaeb1d56ffb1f043ce8101a9d5", "file_path": "Draft+Solicitation+W519TC-25-R-A005+.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-04bf2894f2beedf31145087e97320e9e", "__created_at__": 1759242018, "content": "and operating and support \ncosts.\n(6) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the agency.\n(7) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, \nnoting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.\n(8) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous \nGovernment actions, if known.\n(d) Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Contracting Officer, unless this contract states otherwise. If this contract is administered \nby other than the contracting office, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the VECP simultaneously to the Contracting Officer and to the \nAdministrative Contracting Officer.W519TC25RA005Page 52 of 86\n(e) Government action.\n(1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. If \nadditional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the \nexpected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.\n(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may \nwithdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the \nContractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.\n(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause and made \neither before or within a reasonable time after contract performance is completed. Until such a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, \nthe Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision \nmade solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.\n(f) Sharing rates. If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor shall share in net acquisition savings according to the percentages shown in the table below. \nThe percentage paid the Contractor depends upon-\n(1) This contract's type (fixed-price, incentive, or cost-reimbursement);\n(2) The sharing arrangement specified in paragraph (a) of this clause (incentive, program requirement, or a combination as delineated in the \nSchedule); and\n(3) The source of the savings (the instant contract, or concurrent and future contracts), as follows:\n          \n                 Contractor's Share of Net Acquisition Savings (Figure in Percent)    \n                 Contract Type                 Incentive (Voluntary)                 Program Requirement (Mandatory)  \n                                  Instant Contract Rate                 Concurrent and Future Contract Rate                 Instant Contract Rate                 Concurrent and \nFuture Contract Rate  \n                 Fixed-price (includes fixed-price-award-fee; excludes other fixed-price incentive contracts)                 *50                 *50                 \n25                 25  \n                 Incentive (fixed-price or cost) (other than award fee)                 (**)                 *50                 (**)                 25  \n                 Cost-reimbursement (includes cost-plus-award-fee; excludes other cost-type incentive contracts)                 ***25                 \n***25                 15                 15  \n                 * The Contracting Office may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 75 percent for each VECP.  \n                 ** Same sharing arrangement as the contract's profit or fee adjustment formula.  \n                 *** The Contracting Office may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 50 percent for each VECP.  \n(g) Calculating net acquisition savings.\n(1) Acquisition savings are realized when (i) the cost or price is reduced on the instant contract, (ii) reductions are negotiated in concurrent contracts, \n(iii) future contracts are awarded, or (iv) agreement is reached on a lump-sum payment for future contract savings (see paragraph (i)(4) of this clause). \nNet acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid a share, when Government costs and any negative instant contract savings \nhave been fully offset against acquisition savings.\n(2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be offset \nagainst acquisition savings each time such savings are realized until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated by multiplying net \nacquisition savings by the appropriate Contractor's percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) of this clause). Additional Contractor shares of net \nacquisition savings shall be paid to the Contractor at the time realized.\n(3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent and future \ncontract savings.

The modification accepting the VECP (or a subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any negotiations are \ncompleted) shall-\n(1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract;\n(2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, increase the contract price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated cost by \nthat amount;\n(3) Specify the Contractor's dollar share per unit on future contracts, or provide the lump-sum payment;\n(4) Specify the amount of any Government costs or negative instant contract savings to be offset in determining net acquisition savings realized from \nconcurrent or future contract savings; andW519TC25RA005Page 53 of 86\n(5) Provide the Contractor's share of any net acquisition savings under the instant contract in accordance with the following:\n(i) Fixed-price contracts-add to contract price.\n(ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts-add to contract fee.\n(i) Concurrent and future contract savings.\n(1) Payments of the Contractor's share of concurrent and future contract savings shall be made by a modification to the instant contract in accordance \nwith paragraph (h)(5) of this clause. For incentive contracts, shares shall be added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on the instant contract. The \nContractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract.\n(2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of concurrent contract savings by-\n(i) Subtracting from the reduction in price negotiated on the concurrent contract any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet \noffset; and\n(ii) Multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.\n(3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of future contract savings by-\n(i) Multiplying the future unit cost reduction by the number of future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period;\n(ii) Subtracting any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset; and\n(iii) Multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.\n(4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single lump sum rather \nthan in a series of payments over time as future contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future contract savings may be calculated \nwhen the VECP is accepted, on the basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that will be delivered during the sharing period. \nThe Contractor's share shall be included in a modification to this contract (see paragraph (h)(3) of this clause) and shall not be subject to subsequent \nadjustment.\n(5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with section 48.104-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Government \nand the Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost settlement method, the following applies:\n(i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract and on its concurrent contracts only.\n(ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future contracts, and all \ncollateral savings.\n(j) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this \nclause, by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a \ntypical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed \nthe contract's firm-fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The \nContracting Officer will be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.\n(k) Relationship to other incentives. Only those benefits of an accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost (production unit cost, \noperating and support costs, reliability and maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this clause. However, the targets of such \nincentives affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to \nsurpass them, the value engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target.\n(l) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract-valued at or above the simplified acquisition \nthreshold, as defined in FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any \nadjustment in this contract's price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable development and \nimplementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive \npayments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract. The Contractor may choose any \narrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments, provided, that the payments shall not reduce the Government's share of \nconcurrent or future contract savings or collateral savings.\n(m) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on \nthe affected parts:\nThese data, furnished under the Value Engineering clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, used, or \ndisclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause.

(Apr 2014)\nAs prescribed in 232.706-70, use the following clause: \nLIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION (APR 2014) \n (a) Contract line item(s)  [Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]  is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $  [Contracting \nOfficer insert after negotiations]  of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in \nparagraph (j) of this clause. \n (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\" As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s). \n (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of \nadditional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in \nparagraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated \namount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as \nmay be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional \nfunds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any \nitem(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the \nGovernment.\" \n (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will \nagree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will \napply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly. \n (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely \nperformance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the \nperformance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including \nappropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable \nadjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \"Disputes.\" \n (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph \n(a) of this clause. \n (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled \"Default.\" The provisions of this \nclause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies \nonce the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under W519TC25RA005Page 56 of 86\nparagraphs (d) and (e) of this clause. \n (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination \nfor Convenience of the Government.\" \n (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. \n (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e2104eaeb1d56ffb1f043ce8101a9d5", "file_path": "Draft+Solicitation+W519TC-25-R-A005+.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-bc077a96ac9fe3131d48bc9ce3dcd52a", "__created_at__": 1759242018, "content": ") and (e) of this clause. \n (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination \nfor Convenience of the Government.\" \n (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. \n (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule: \n  \n                 On execution of contract                  $ See Task Order   \n                 (month) (day), (year)                  $ See Task Order   \n                 (month) (day), (year)                  $ ____   \n                 (month) (day), (year)                  $ ____   \n(End of clause) \n252.237-7023 Continuation of Essential Contractor Services.

The Government may contact the POCs provided, and reserves the right to \ncontact additional POCs as necessary.\nL.2.1.3 Offerors shall submit Work Samples (contracts/orders) which demonstrate their technical experience in the required \ncategories. Work Samples may count toward multiple categories. Future performance periods on an existing contract do not \ndemonstrate technical experience and shall not be utilized as Work Samples, nor be factored into the total point value of a \nsubmitted sample. An acceptable Work Sample is defined as either an IDIQ contract, non-IDIQ contract, or a task order under \nan IDIQ contract (FAR16.501-1), on which the Offeror performed for at least one year, with that one year taking place within \nthe last seven years of the release date of this solicitation. For all current and ongoing Work Samples the Offeror shall calculate \ntheir points based on data up until proposal submission.

The \nGovernment will accept a Statement of Fact from the cognizant contracting officer or contracting officer representative (COR) \nto confirm missing information, should contractual documents not carry all the information necessary to substantiate the \nOfferor's scores. The Offeror will need to provide this statement (if needed) and submit as part of its proposal. The Offeror shall \nnot create any new documentation (project narratives or project descriptions) outside of the project reference. Where official \ncontract documentation is insufficient to substantiate a Self-Rated Score, the Offeror may utilize corporate system reports as \ndocumentation. When corporate system reports are utilized, the citation must include a signed statement attesting to the validity \nof the reports.

However, the Government reserves the right, as noted \nabove, to conduct discussions to resolve any inconsistencies. Offerors shall ensure that all key factual information (such as dates, \nquantities, product numbers, etc.) are included in the slides to reduce the chances that information will be missed during the oral \npresentation.\nL.3.1.6.6 The oral presentation will not become a part of any contract resulting from this RFP but will be evaluated for purposes \nof award decision.

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a provision may be accessed \nelectronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/.\nIf the provision requires additional or unique information, then that information is provided immediately after the provision title.\nM.1 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS \nM.1.1 The Government will review the Offeror's proposal for compliance with Section L. Any deviations or non-compliances \ndiscovered in the compliance review may results in the proposal being rejected. Any proposal information that does not comply \nwith Section L requirements (e.g., extra pages or non-complaint text) will be removed or redacted, as appropriate, and will not \nbe evaluated. \nM.1.2 The Government reserves the right to make no award if it is in the best interest of the Government. The Government \nreserves the right to not make an award at a price premium that it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the \nevaluated superiority of one proposal over another. The Government also reserves the right to make no award should no \nproposal prove to be Acceptable or better based on the criteria set forth in the Solicitation. \nM.1.3 The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance \nwill include areas not specified in the Offeror's proposal. \nM.1.4 The Offeror's proposal should contain its best terms. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract \nafter conducting discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to award without conducting discussions if it is \ndetermined to be in the Government's best interest. Discussions will only be held with Offerors whose proposals are within the \ncompetitive range. If the Procuring Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the \ncompetitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Procuring Contracting Officer \nmay limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition \namong the most highly rated proposals.\nM.1.5 An Offeror's submittal of unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, for even a single Technical Experience evaluation \ncriterion, may result in the Government determining that the Offeror's proposed Self-Rated Score is disingenuous and/or \nartificially inflated. This disingenuous or artificially inflated score may result in the Government determining the Offerors \nproposal to be disqualified and not awardable. The Government may unilaterally downward adjust the Offeror's score, \npotentially down to zero points.\nM.1.6 The Government will evaluate proposals using a two-phase approach. In the first phase, the Government will validate the \nSelf-Rated Scores to determine a Validated-Rated Score using the Offeror's Self-Scoring Matrix and Work Samples with \nincluded Project References. If the Validated-Rated Score, is above the minimum threshold of 60,000 out of 80,000 for Factors \n1.1-1.4, the Government will notify the Offeror that they shall submit the information requested in Section L for Factors 2.1-2.4 \nno later than 0900 central 20 days after notification. If the Validated-Rated Score, is below the minimum threshold of 60,000 for \nFactors 1.1-1.4, the Government will notify the Offeror that their proposal will not be given further consideration, and they will \nbe removed from the competition. The Government reserves the right to ask Offerors to clarify information included in Offeror's \nWork Sample submissions for the Phase I Self-Scoring Matrix. In the second phase, the Government will evaluate Offeror's \nFactors 2.1-2.4 in accordance with Section M. The Government will conduct a best value trade-off evaluation with Factors 2.1-\n2.4 in accordance with the processes outlined in Section M.3. The Government intends to award after discussions with Offerors \nwho qualify to participate in Phase II. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions if it is in the best interest \nof the Government. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.\nM.2 PHASE I \nM.2.1 PHASE I INSTRUCTIONS \nM.2.1.1 The Government will perform a compliance check for all submitted information required to be considered eligible for \naward. Non-compliant proposals are proposals that are inconsistent with Section L. Non-compliant proposals may not be further \nevaluated. Only Offerors whose proposals are determined to be compliant will move into the evaluation process. \nM.2.1.2 The Government will validate the Self-Rated Scores of each Factor. To do this, the Government will use the Self-\nScoring Matrix and Work Samples with Project References provided by the Offeror. If the Government is unable to find the W519TC25RA005Page 80 of 86\nsubstantiating information within the referenced page, paragraph, table, etc., the Government will not search further for the \nsubstantiating information. If the Government is unable to validate that Offeror's Self-Rated Score based on the Work Samples \nprovided, the Government will unilaterally downward adjust the Offeror's Self-Rated Score, potentially down to zero points. The \nGovernment will only adjust the Offeror's Self-Rated Score downward, not upward.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 2.1, \"Best \nvalue means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in \nresponse to the requirement.\" The Government intends to award one contract to a single Offeror as a result of this Solicitation. \nM.3.1.2 Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Government. The relative \norder of importance assigned to the evaluation factors are: \nM.3.1.2.1 The Maintenance Factor is the most important factor and is more important than the following two equally important \nfactors (Demil and Innovation/Business Development). \nM.3.1.2.2 The Demil and Innovation/Business Development Factors are equally important. \nM.3.1.2.3 The Demil and Innovation/Business Development Factors are more important than the Price Factor. \nM.3.1.2.4 All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. \nM.3.1.3 To receive consideration for award, the Offeror must receive a rating of no less than Acceptable for the Maintenance, \nDemil, and Innovation/Business Development Factors.

(Apr 2014)\nLIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION (APR 2014)\n(a)Contract line item(s) is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $  to be specified on  individual task orders   to be specified \n of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in on individual task orders\nparagraph (j) of this clause.\n(b)For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the  \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be   \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\" As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government  \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s).\n(c)Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in  \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of  \nadditional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in \nparagraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated  \namount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as \nmay be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional  \nfunds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any \nitem(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the \nGovernment.\"\n(d)When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will  \nagree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will  \napply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.\n(e)If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely  \nperformance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the \nperformance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including \nappropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable  \nadjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \"Disputes.\"\n(f)The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph  \n(a) of this clause.\nPage 40 of 71\nN6945025R0003(g)The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled \"Default.\" The provisions of this   \nclause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies  \nonce the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under \nparagraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.\n(h)Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for  \nConvenience of the Government.\"\n(i)Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. \n(j)The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule: \nOn execution of", "full_doc_id": "doc-7169852945d0fa1af6ee1a5bbe5640fc", "file_path": "_N6945025R0003.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-96a94fae60daae3ac6dc76739c020c34", "__created_at__": 1759243459, "content": "d) and (e) of this clause.\n(h)Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for  \nConvenience of the Government.\"\n(i)Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. \n(j)The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule: \nOn execution of contract $ To be specified on individual task orders $ ____ $ ____\n(month) (day), (year) $ ____ $ ____ $ ____\n(month) (day), (year) $ ____ $ ____ $ ____\n(month) (day), (year) $ ____ $ ____ $ ____\n(End of clause)\nPage 41 of 71\nN6945025R0003Section J - List of Attachments\nSection J - Table of Contents list the Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments for this Section are posted on the SAM website at  https://.sam.gov/\nwith the solicitation.\nThe ACQUISITION documents are posted as individual file names as indicated in the table below.

The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor. \nPage 61 of 71\nN6945025R0003(a) Price:\n1. Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(a) Provide a completed Section B of the solicitation.\n(b) Provide a completed Section J Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Pricing Attachment. There are multiple worksheets within this file that require \ncompletion.  \n(c) Submit pricing data (Section B and Section J ELINs) in hard copy and in electronic (Microsoft Office Version 365 compatible) format on CD-\nROM. Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation).

The evaluation will collectively consider the DART rate, TCR, Technical \nApproach to Safety, and other sources of information available to the Government as part of such collective evaluation. The board will evaluate the \nDART rates and TCR to determine if the offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any negative trends and \nextenuating circumstances that impact the rating.\n(i) DART Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one risk level (or more) to the next up or \ndown. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the offeror to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions \ntaken for improvement.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing DART rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate.\n(4) This chart correlates the DART rate to the level of risk:\nRisk DART Rate\nVery Low Risk Less Than 1.0\nLow Risk From 1.0 to 1.99\nModerate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99\nHigh Risk From 3.0 to 4.0\nExtremely High Risk Greater than 4.0\n(ii) TCR Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one \nrisk level (or more) to the next up or down.

If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in \nthe solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS IS AVAILABLE.\n(ii) If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed \nPPQs should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing \ndate, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Attachment D), which will provide contract and client \ninformation for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client \nrequests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Courtney Peterson or Cari Fiebach via email at courtney.j.\npeterson3.civ@us.navy.mil or cari.l.fiebach.civ@us.navy.mil prior to proposal closing date. Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their \nproposal PPQs or CPARS previously submitted for other RFPs. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted \nPPQ information in the past performance evaluation.\n(iii) Also, include performance recognition documents received within the last five (5) years such as awards, award fee determinations, customer \nletters of commendation, and any other forms of performance recognition. \n(iv) Sources of Past Performance Information for evaluation that may be used are as follows: \nPast performance information provided by the offeror, as solicited;\nPast performance information obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition; and\nPast performance information obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, Contractor Performance \nAssessment Reporting System (CPARS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract \nReporting System (eSRS), or other databases; the Defense Contract Management Agency; and interviews with Program Managers, Contracting \nOfficers, and Fee Determining Officials.\n(v) While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past \nperformance information rests with the offeror.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation: The Government will evaluate how well the offeror performed on the recent, relevant projects submitted under Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience, and on other recent, relevant contracts documented in known sources. There are three aspects of the past performance \nevaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. The first is to evaluate the recency of the offeror's past performance. The second aspect is to determine the \nrelevancy of the offeror's past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\nN6945025R0003(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In this case, the offeror's past \nperformance is unknown and assigned a confidence rating of \"neutral.\"\nFAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference\nNumber TitleEffective \nDateAlternate/\nDeviationVariation\nEffective\nDate\n52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.
