An allotment schedule is set forth in on individual task orders\nparagraph (j) of this clause.\n(b)For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the  \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract.The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point.The Government will not be   \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\"As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government  \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s).\n(c)Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in  \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s).The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of  \nadditional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds

Contracting Officer will terminate any \nitem(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the \nGovernment.\"\n(d)When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will  \nagree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds.The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will  \napply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute

additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including \nappropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both.Failure to agree to any such equitable  \nadjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \"Disputes.\"\n(f)The

Failure to do so may be cause to \nrender the offer non-responsive. Because the pricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a \ndiscrepancy between the price proposal hard copies and the price proposal electronic copies, the price proposal electronic copies will take \nprecedence.\n       1. Reminder - The proposed ELIN Pricing should be allocated based upon each customer's solicitation requirements. For example, \ncustomers with comparable requirements should be priced similarly. As stated in the Price Evaluation Factor, the Government will evaluate \nthe price proposal for unbalanced pricing, which may be found when line pricing at any level is overstated or understated.\ne. All ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall \nbe calculated based on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the \nGovernment will round the unit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for \nevaluation purposes.\nf.

The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue - the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR \n15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if \nthe Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an \nefficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number \nthat will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.\n3. The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor. \nPage 61 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(a) Price:\n1. Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(a) Provide a completed Section B of the solicitation.\n(b) Provide a completed Section J Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Pricing Attachment. There are multiple worksheets within this file that require \ncompletion.  \n(c) Submit pricing data (Section B and Section J ELINs) in hard copy and in electronic (Microsoft Office Version 365 compatible) format on CD-\nROM. Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Analysis will be \nperformed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:\n(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.\n(ii) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGE.\n(iii) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.\n(iv) Comparison of market survey results.\n(v) And/or any other methodology deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer and consistent with FAR 15.404-1.\nb. The Government will evaluate the price proposal for unbalanced pricing, and may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed \nare materially unbalanced and represent an unacceptable risk to the government. In general, unbalanced pricing may be found when, despite an \nacceptable total evaluated price, line pricing at any level, between functional annexes/sub-annexes, periods of performance, type of work, or otherwise \nmay be relatively and significantly overstated or understated.\nc. The Government will evaluate the proposal for any inconsistent pricing submitted within Section B and the Section J ELIN attachment, and correct \nany discrepancies in accordance with Section M.3 of the solicitation, or through clarifications, discussions or other means consistent with applicable \nregulations. \n(b) Non-cost/price Factors:\nThe offeror's response to factors that require the submission of Corporate Experience and Past Performance shall be based on the following relevancy \ndefinition:\nRELEVANT PROJECT:  Relevant projects include those that demonstrate the capability to perform services similar in size, scope, and complexity \nto those described in the performance work statement/specifications of the RFP with a contract value of $15,000,000.00 per year or greater that is \neither: 1) ongoing with at least 12 months of contract performance completed by the date of receipt of initial proposals, or 2) completed within the last \nfive (5) years of date of receipt of initial proposals. For purposes of this evaluation, Base Operations Support (BOS) services (or equivalent) projects \nshall encompass at least three of the following and a minimum of one other technical annex/sub-annex as part of the scope of work (see Factor 3 for a \nlist of annexes/sub-annexes):\na. 0600000 - Port Operations (similar to the requirements of this RFP)\nb. 1502000 - Facility Investment (at minimum, including the completion of service orders, HVAC Systems maintenance and repairs, Fire Protection \nSystems maintenance and repairs, and two other facility investment spec items identified in the RFP).\nc. 1602000 - Electrical similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Transmission & Distributions operations, maintenance and repairs).\nd. 1606000 - Water similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Raw Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant and Distribution System \noperation, Laboratory and Testing processes, maintenance and repairs).\ne. 1700000 - BSVE (at minimum, including operations, maintenance and repair of Civil Engineering Support Equipment (CESE) and Weight \nHandling Equipment (WHE) similar to the requirements of this RFP).\nAnnexes 0100000 - General Information and 0200000 - Management and Administration will not be considered towards the minimum of one other \ntechnical annex/sub-annex requirement to demonstrate a relevant project.\nPage 62 of 71\nN6945025R0003\nComplexity will be determined based on the projects' contract type, facilities maintained (size, quantity and type), systems maintained (quantities and \ncapacities), and program structure (combination of Preventive Maintenance (PM) Program, E/U/R work orders or service orders, Integrated \nMaintenance Program (IMP), other recurring services).\n(1) Factor 1, Corporate Experience:\n(a). Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nThe offeror shall submit a minimum of two (2) to a maximum of five (5) examples of recent, relevant projects that the offeror (including joint \nventures and partnerships) completed and served as the prime contractor.

JV offerors are still limited to a total of five (5) recent and relevant projects.\nIf a project was performed by a JV, and not all partners from the prior JV are proposing on this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly demonstrate what \nportion of the work on the submitted project was performed by the JV partner offering on this solicitation. If the offeror does not specifically address \nwhat portion of the work under the submitted project was performed by the JV partner offering on this contract, the project will not be considered \nrelevant.\nAn offeror may rely on the prime contractor experience or corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies, and parent \ncompanies) to demonstrate experience, provided the offeror submits all of the following:\n(i) A one-page narrative clearly demonstrating that the corporate affiliates will have meaningful participation in the project by identifying the \npersonnel or resources from the corporate affiliates that will be dedicated to the project;\n(ii) An organization chart that demonstrates the corporate relationship of the affiliates, and\n(iii) Teaming Agreement/letter of commitment\n(a) Basis of Evaluation.\nThe assessment of the offeror's recent and relevant experience will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the offeror to successfully meet \nthe requirements of this solicitation. The Government will consider the depth and breadth of the relevant experience, focusing on performance of \ntechnical specifications to be performed under this contract, to evaluate the level of risk of unsuccessful performance. The Government will review \nonly five (5) projects. Any projects submitted in excess of the five (5) project limit will not be considered.\nOfferors who fail to submit a minimum of two (2) examples of recent, relevant projects that the offeror (including joint ventures and partnerships) \ncompleted and served as the prime contractor will be considered unacceptable.\nOfferors who fail to demonstrate relevant experience in one or more of the following annexes/sub-annexes will be considered unacceptable:\n(a) 0600000 - Port Operations (similar to the requirements of this RFP);\n(b) 1502000 - Facility Investment similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, including the completion of E/U/R work orders or service \norders, HVAC Systems maintenance and repairs, Fire Protection Systems maintenance and repairs, and two other facility investment spec items \nidentified in the RFP);\n(c) 1602000 - Electrical similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Transmission & Distributions operations, maintenance and repairs);\n(d) 1606000 - Water similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Raw Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant and Distribution System \noperation, Laboratory and Testing processes, maintenance and repairs);\n(e) 1700000 - BSVE (at minimum, including operations, maintenance and repair of CESE and WHE similar to the requirements of this RFP);\nPage 63 of 71\nN6945025R0003\nOfferors who demonstrate relevant project experience in any of the remaining technical annexes/sub-annexes may be evaluated more favorably.\nProjects completed by the offeror or its corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies and parent companies) in any \ncapacity other than as prime contractor will be considered not relevant.\nProjects completed by a proposed subcontractor will be considered not relevant.\nProjects submitted by JVs where the JV partners performed together may be evaluated more favorably than projects in which the JV partners did not \nperform together.\nWith the exception of offerors covered by Mentor-Protege Agreements approved by the Small Business Administration, if the offeror is a JV, each \nmember of the JV must demonstrate prime contractor experience on at least one relevant project. If each member of the JV does not have at least one \nrelevant experience project, then the offeror will be considered unacceptable.\nOfferors who demonstrate experience without relying on corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies and parent \ncompanies) may be evaluated more favorably.\nFor multiple award contracts (MACs) or indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, the specific relevant task order, not the entire MAC \nor IDIQ contract, will be considered a project for evaluation purposes.\n(2) Factor 2, Management Approach:\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nThe offeror shall clearly demonstrate a feasible approach for controlling and managing the entire project, including the interface between the major \nfunctional areas and sub-annexes, and the offeror's general management and administration structure.

For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In this case, the offeror's past \nperformance is unknown and assigned a confidence rating of \"neutral.\"\nFAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference\nNumber Title Effective \nDate\nAlternate/\nDeviation\nVariation\nEffective\nDate\n52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.

For this/these item(s), the sum of $ \n \nto be specified on individual task orders \nto be specified \n of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in \non individual task orders\nparagraph (j) of this clause.\n(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the \n \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be \n \n \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\" As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government \n \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s).\n(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in \n \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s).

The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue - the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR \n15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if \nthe Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an \nefficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number \nthat will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.\n3. The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor. \nPage 61 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n(a) Price:\n1. Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(a) Provide a completed Section B of the solicitation.\n(b) Provide a completed Section J Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Pricing Attachment. There are multiple worksheets within this file that require \ncompletion.  \n(c) Submit pricing data (Section B and Section J ELINs) in hard copy and in electronic (Microsoft Office Version 365 compatible) format on CD-\nROM. Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Analysis will be \nperformed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:\n(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.\n(ii) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGE.\n(iii) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.\n(iv) Comparison of market survey results.\n(v) And/or any other methodology deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer and consistent with FAR 15.404-1.\nb. The Government will evaluate the price proposal for unbalanced pricing, and may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed \nare materially unbalanced and represent an unacceptable risk to the government.

Should a negative trend occur above moderate risk \nlevels, an acceptable/detailed explanation is required that includes any corrective actions taken for improvement.\n(1) TCR cases include injuries or illnesses resulting in death, days away from work, restricted work or transfer to another job days beyond the day of \ninjury/illness, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.\n(2) Calculation of TCR rate: Multiply the total number of TCR incidents by 200,000, and then divide by the number of employee labor hours worked.\nTCR RATE=(Number of TCR Incidents x 200,000)/(Total Number of Employee Labor Hours Worked)\n(iii) Technical Approach to Safety: Submit a narrative that addresses the following:\nPage 68 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n1.  \n(1) Describe the offeror' s approach to implementing and executing a Safety Management System (SMS) including Management/Leadership \ninvolvement, Employee involvement, Hazard prevention, Hazard control, Worksite analysis, and Safety and health training, to include the standard(s) \nused to benchmark the SMS.\n(2) Describe the evaluation process used to select potential subcontractors.\n(3) Describe the processes of how the offeror will oversee safety compliance of subcontractors at all levels throughout performance of the contract (to \ninclude the offeror's own in-house workforce).\n(4) The Technical Approach to Safety narrative shall be limited to two (2) single-sided pages or one (1) double-sided page.\n(iv) The Government reserves the right to review other available sources (public/Government internal) of information. These may include but are not \nlimited to OSHA data, NAVFAC's Contractor Incident Reporting System (CIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), \nElectronic Contract Management System (eCMS), etc.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation.\nThe Government is seeking to determine that the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the offeror plans to properly \nmanage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The evaluation will collectively consider the DART rate, TCR, Technical \nApproach to Safety, and other sources of information available to the Government as part of such collective evaluation. The board will evaluate the \nDART rates and TCR to determine if the offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any negative trends and \nextenuating circumstances that impact the rating.\n(i) DART Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one risk level (or more) to the next up or \ndown. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the offeror to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions \ntaken for improvement.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing DART rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate.\n(4) This chart correlates the DART rate to the level of risk:\nRisk\nDART Rate\nVery Low Risk\nLess Than 1.0\nLow Risk\nFrom 1.0 to 1.99\nModerate Risk\nFrom 2.0 to 2.99\nHigh Risk\nFrom 3.0 to 4.0\nExtremely High Risk Greater than 4.0\n(ii) TCR Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one \nrisk level (or more) to the next up or down. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the \nofferor to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions taken for improvement.\n1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue--the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing TCR rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate\nThis chart correlates the TCR rate to the level of risk:\nRisk\nTCR Rate\nVery Low Risk\nLess Than 2.49\nLow Risk\nFrom 2.5 to 3.49\nModerate Risk\nFrom 3.5 to 4.49\nHigh Risk\nFrom 4.5 to 5.99\nPage 69 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\nExtremely High Risk Greater than 6.0\n(iii) The Technical Approach to Safety Narrative. To determine the degree to which the offeror:\n(1) Describes a viable SMS that addresses elements; such as Management/Leadership involvement, Employee involvement, Hazard prevention, \nHazard control, Worksite analysis, and Safety and health training, to include the standard(s) used to benchmark the SMS.\n(2) Describes a methodical process of evaluating subcontractor's safety performance in their selection process.\n(3) Describes a logical management plan to hold themselves and their subcontractors accountable for adhering to the safety requirements of the \ncontract.\n(4) The Technical Approach to Safety narrative shall be limited to two (2) single-sided pages or one (1) double-sided page. Information on pages \nbeyond this will not be considered.\n(iv) The Government reserves the right to review other available sources (public/Government internal) of information. These may include but are not \nlimited to OSHA data, NAVFAC's Contractor Incident Reporting System (CIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), \nElectronic Contract Management System (eCMS), etc.\n(v) Any contractor job-related mishap death within the past five years may be assigned an unacceptable safety factor rating. Any fatalities experienced \nwithin this 5-year timeframe must be explained in detail, to include root cause and corrective actions.\n(6) Factor 6, Past Performance:\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nFOR EACH PROJECT IDENTIFIED IN RESPONSE TO FACTOR 1, IF A COMPLETED CPARS EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE, IT SHALL \nBE SUBMITTED WITH THE PROPOSAL. If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in \nthe solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS IS AVAILABLE.\n(ii) If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed \nPPQs should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing \ndate, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Attachment D), which will provide contract and client \ninformation for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client \nrequests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Courtney Peterson or Cari Fiebach via email at courtney.j.\npeterson3.civ@us.navy.mil or cari.l.fiebach.civ@us.navy.mil prior to proposal closing date. Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their \nproposal PPQs or CPARS previously submitted for other RFPs. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted \nPPQ information in the past performance evaluation.\n(iii) Also, include performance recognition documents received within the last five (5) years such as awards, award fee determinations, customer \nletters of commendation, and any other forms of performance recognition. \n(iv) Sources of Past Performance Information for evaluation that may be used are as follows: \nPast performance information provided by the offeror, as solicited;\nPast performance information obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition; and\nPast performance information obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, Contractor Performance \nAssessment Reporting System (CPARS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract \nReporting System (eSRS), or other databases; the Defense Contract Management Agency; and interviews with Program Managers, Contracting \nOfficers, and Fee Determining Officials.\n(v) While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past \nperformance information rests with the offeror.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation: The Government will evaluate how well the offeror performed on the recent, relevant projects submitted under Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience, and on other recent, relevant contracts documented in known sources. There are three aspects of the past performance \nevaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. The first is to evaluate the recency of the offeror's past performance. The second aspect is to determine the \nrelevancy of the offeror's past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In this case, the offeror's past \nperformance is unknown and assigned a confidence rating of \"neutral.\"\nFAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference\nNumber\nTitle\nEffective \nDate\nAlternate/\nDeviation\nVariation\nEffective\nDate\n52.217-5\nEvaluation of Options.\nJul 1990\nPage 71 of 71",

Now it is.\nMost training for sales professionals focuses on enhancing \nsales skills and explaining the features and advantages of \ntheir organization’s products and services, but not on how \nto direct, prepare, or contribute to proposals. This is the first \neasy-to-use reference for business development professionals \nwho are seeking practical, clear guidance on how to win \ncompetitive business in all markets, large or small, domestic or \ninternational, private sector or public.\nAdvise best-practice guidelines.\nAt Shipley Associates, we have observed and recommended \nindustry best practices in business development training, \nconsulting, and process reengineering since 1972.

When in doubt, do \nwhat the customer says and be consistent.\nWhat’s New in the Sixth Edition\nTo reflect changes in business practice, the following topic \nsections were updated: Storyboard and Mockups: Content \nPlanning Tools, Daily Proposal Team Management, Electronic \nSubmittal, and Production.\nSome graphics were updated in these sections to improve \nmessaging. Documents in the Model Documents section were \nchanged, eliminated, or updated.\nThe Shipley Proposal Guide, Capture Guide, and Lifecycle Guide \nare still extensively cross-referenced and integrated.

Avoid overusing unfamiliar and unnecessary \nacronyms and initialisms as they can obscure meaning and \nproject an arrogant tone.\nIn general, if the word would be capitalized, then the \nabbreviation would be capitalized. Exceptions to this rule \ninclude DoD, written with a lowercase o, as used by the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense and laser and radar, which have been \naccepted as words. Companies and organizations may deviate \nfrom the capitalization rule when abbreviating their own name \nor products.

Proposal evaluators seldom read \nan entire proposal front-to-back. Instead, they read portions, \nseeking answers to specific questions.\nIf an abbreviation might be unfamiliar to any reader, define \nit. Proposal evaluators are multiple and varied. Your proposal \nmust be clear to everyone, not almost everyone. \nSelect and consistently follow one \nof two naming conventions:\n1.\t Write the full name followed \nby the abbreviation in \nparentheses at the first mention in each major section.\nOur cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) software supports \nmedical clinics of all sizes.\n2.\t Write the abbreviation followed by the full name in \nparentheses at the first mention in each major section.\nOur cloud-based EHR (Electronic Health Record) software supports \nmedical clinics of all sizes. \nStyle guides offer conflicting \nadvice.

(Latin et alibi)—and others; and elsewhere\netc. (Latin et cetera)—and so on; and the rest\ni.e. (Latin id est)—that is; namely; in other words\nP.S. (Latin postscriptum)—to write after\nAvoid a potentially arrogant \ntone by eliminating foreign \nlanguage phrases unless \naddressing or using a \ncustomer’s phrase.\nCustomarily, titles are placed before the name and positions \nare placed after the name, for example, Mr. Frank Nestor, \nAccount Manager.\nTitles before proper names\nMr. Stephen Shipley\nDr. Jonas Salk\nProf. Edward Dean\nDr. Katie Bouman\nTitles after proper names\nCathy Allen, M.D.\nFrancis Wilkins, C.P.A.\nDo not abbreviate a title that is not used with a proper name:\nNot this\nSeveral Drs. protested additional malpractice insurance increases.\nThis\nSeveral doctors protested additional malpractice insurance increases.\nAvoid redundant titles such as Dr. Evan Luce, Ph.D. Choose one \ntitle or the other: Dr. Evan Luce or Evan Luce, Ph.D.\n5\t\nUSE STANDARD ABBREVIATIONS FOR TITLES IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER \nPROPER NAMES.\n4\t\nDEVELOP A LIST OF ACCEPTABLE ABBREVIATIONS BEFORE THE PROPOSAL \nKICKOFF MEETING, AND KEEP IT CURRENT.\nCut editing time by developing a list of acceptable \nabbreviations, jargon, and other naming conventions before \nthe initial kickoff meeting. Pass it out at the kickoff meeting, \nand keep it current. \nConsider these questions:\n•\t How will you refer to the customer? \n•\t What will you call your bidding team?\n•\t Will you use U.S.A. or USA?\n•\t What terms or words do you want to encourage or \ndiscourage using?\nContributors often conceive more unique naming conventions \nthan you can find and fix with the simple search and replace \ntool in your software package. Creating and publishing a \ngroup-approved abbreviation list can reduce the amount \nof editing required to remove unapproved, conflicting, or \npotentially embarrassing items before submission.\n\nAbbreviations\nShipley Proposal Guide\n15\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nAVOID INAPPROPRIATE ABBREVIATIONS.\nIn proposal writing, avoid the following abbreviations in body \ntext: personal names, holidays, units of measurement, days, \nmonths, divisions of written works, cities, states, countries, \nand parts of business names unless they are part of the official \nname.\nPersonal name\nCharles (not Chas)\nHolidays\nChristmas (not Xmas)\nUnits of measurement\npound (not lb.)\nDays and months\nMonday, December (not Mon., Dec.)\nDivisions of written work\nchapter, section, page (not ch., sec., p.)\nStates and countries\nMontana (not Mont., or MT)\nParts of business name\nShipley Associates (not SA, or Shipley Assoc.)\nUse B.C.E., C.E., a.m., p.m., No., and $ only with specific dates, \ntimes, numbers, and amounts. \n400 B.C.E.\n10:30 a.m.\n3:00 p.m.\nC.E. 40\nNo. 12 (or no. 12)\n$1000\n8\t\nUSE A SINGLE PERIOD WHEN AN ABBREVIATION ENDS A SENTENCE.\nNote this example:\nThe final decision maker is Kevin Keats, Ph.D.\nHowever, if the sentence or clause ends with punctuation \nother than a period, then the other punctuation mark follows \nthe period at the end of the abbreviation. \nWill the final purchase decision be made by Kevin Keats, Ph.D.?\nIf your proposal arrives before 3 p.m., it will be evaluated.\nEliminate periods and spaces within most abbreviations unless \nconvention dictates otherwise. Refer to a current dictionary, as \nconventions evolve.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n16\n©Shipley Associates\nACTION CAPTIONS\nWhile the graphic catches the reader’s eye, the caption must \ndeliver the persuasive message. Good captions interpret, \ninform, and persuade. \nA graphic and its action caption enable the evaluator to grasp \nyour key message without having to search the text for an \nexplanation. Many evaluators, especially key decision makers, \nhave little time and will skim \nyour proposal. If the point of \na graphic is not obvious, they \nwill simply turn the page.\nCreate an action caption \nfor every graphic in your \nproposal, including photos, \ndrawings, charts, graphs, \ntables, and even spreadsheets. While not universally done \nin all business documents, labeling all types of graphics as \nfigures makes it easier for the evaluators and will simplify \ndesktop publishing the proposal. \nBoth evaluators and writers welcome this simplification \nbecause many graphics are combinations of photos, \nillustrations, tables, and charts.\nRemember the 10-Second Rule. \nIf readers don’t get the point \nwithin 10 seconds, they will turn \nthe page.\nLabeling all types of graphics as \nfigures differs from traditional \ntechnical writing practice but is \nincreasingly accepted.\nACTION CAPTIONS\nUse interpretative action captions with every graphic \nin your proposal.\nDraft each action caption with three parts: the figure \nnumber, the title, and the caption.\nUse informative titles rather than single-word titles.\n1\n2\n3\nConnect a customer benefit to the feature \ndepicted in the graphic.\n4\nQuantify the benefit, if possible.\nPlace action captions below the graphic.\nReference all graphics by figure number in \npreceding text.\n5\n6\n7\nUse a different typeface or style for the figure title, \nthe caption, and the body text of the proposal.\n8\nAction captions suggest action. Readers of an action caption should accept your ideas and begin to accept your proposal \nas the best solution to their needs. \n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n17\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nUSE INTERPRETATIVE ACTION CAPTIONS WITH EVERY GRAPHIC  \nIN YOUR PROPOSAL.\nGraphics attract an evaluator’s eye. Action captions add \nyour spin or interpretation. If you do not interpret a graphic, \nevaluators are left to draw their own conclusion. \nGood captions interpret the visual and suggest the benefit to \nthe evaluators’ organization:\nFigure 1. Flexible Voice Messaging System. You can end lost orders \nthrough dropped customer calls with our graphic operator interface \nand advanced networking software. Our modular design allows for \neasy change, expansion, and flexibility.\nEvaluators read proposals with some skepticism. Why risk \nunfavorable interpretations when you can offer a clear, \nsupportable interpretation and explanation in the caption?\nNote how the action caption above increases the believability \nof the writer’s claim by repeating flexible in the caption. \nOne insightful evaluator stated:\nWe went to the graphics and captions for the answer to our questions. \nIf we found the answer, we didn’t bother to read the text. \nProposal professionals have varying opinions concerning \nthe proper length of an action caption. One view is to limit \ncaptions to a phrase or a single sentence. Unfortunately, \nshort captions may omit important data or force evaluators to \nsearch the body text. \nDo not worry too much about longer captions. Two to three \nsentences, while longer than normal, are acceptable and \neffective if they convey important information to the evaluator \nand are clear.\nCaptions are far more likely to be read than body text. Once \na point is made in the caption, you do not have to repeat it \nin the body text. However, key points should be repeated for \nemphasis in slightly different words.\nThe following are examples of good action captions:\nFigure 3. Proven Technology for the Bishah Plant. A few of our most \nsignificant design improvements are shown, all proven in production. \nYou achieve a competitive market advantage while reducing operat-\ning cost and risk.\nFigure 4. Low-Risk, Six-Phase Implementation. We have identified \nthe key milestones and deliverables for each phase. The plan, as \noutlined, is flexible to permit us to incorporate changes based on our \nmutual review of the prior phase.\nFigure 5. Military Design Standards Increase Cost. While military \ndesign standards for ruggedization appear to increase operation-\nal life, the low production quantity and added weight both triple \nacquisition cost and double operational cost. The minimal increase in \noperational life does not justify the large cost increase.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n18\n©Shipley Associates\n2 \t DRAFT EACH ACTION CAPTION WITH THREE PARTS: THE FIGURE NUMBER,  \nTHE TITLE, AND THE CAPTION.\nFigure numbers are used to reference graphics in body text \nbefore the graphic appears. Number figures sequentially \nin your proposal. On large proposals, number figures \nsequentially throughout major sections, as illustrated in this \nProposal Guide. \nWhen your proposal has numbered chapters or sections, insert \nthe chapter or section number followed by the sequential \nfigure number: \nFigure 3-1. \nFigure 3-2. \nFigure 3-3.\nUsing detailed section \nnumbers is a good idea \nduring proposal development \nto facilitate coordinating \ntext and graphics from \nmultiple writers. The author \nof proposal section 3.4.5.1 \nwould number the first graphic as:\nFigure 3.4.5.1-1. Flexible Voice Messaging System.\nHowever, this long figure number in the final proposal is \ncumbersome for the evaluator, so limit figure numbers in final \nproposal production to numbering within the major section. \nThe previous example might change to:\nFigure 3–12. Flexible Voice Messaging System.\nStandard business writing convention is to discriminate \nfigures, tables, charts, exhibits, etc. This practice can be both \nconfusing in the normal proposal evaluation process and more \ndifficult for proposal management and production. \nFor example, what do you call a spreadsheet with an inset \ngraph or a graph with an inset table? At the risk of upsetting \nthe writing experts, label all graphics as figures or exhibits to \nmake it easier for both evaluators and proposal writers.\nBecause a proposal is a sales document, follow the figure \nnumber with an informative or interpretative title, as discussed \nin guideline 3. \nFollow the title with an action caption that contains features \nand benefits and links the customer benefit to the relevant \nfeatures shown in the graphic. \nConnecting features and benefits is easier when a full sentence \nis used, or even several sentences. Phrases often contain only a \nbenefit or only a feature:\nBenefit only\nFigure 3–12. Flexible Voice Messaging System. \nLow cost solution.\nFeature only\nFigure 3–12.

Our low-cost solu-\ntion is due to the graphic operator interface and advanced network-\ning software.\nSome proposal writers and \neditors prefer to use the detailed \nsection number throughout the \nfinal proposal. A compromise \nis to limit figure numbers to \nthird-order section numbers in \nfinal production.\nSee FEATURES, \nADVANTAGES,  \nAND BENEFITS.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n19\n©Shipley Associates\nO R I G I N A L\nR E V I S E D\nFigure 3.

The original has a single-word title, stating the obvious: This is an image of someone snowboarding. The \nrevised version has an informative title that is reinforced and explained in the caption.\n3 \t USE INFORMATIVE TITLES RATHER THAN SINGLE-WORD TITLES.\nLabels are often ambiguous. Envision a picture of a horse  \nin your proposal with the following caption:\nFigure 7. Horse. \nWhile most people laugh at this title, search your own \nproposals for similar examples:\nFigure 8. Organization Chart\nFigure 9. Approach\nFigure 10. Schedule \nThe following example is marginally better:\nFigure 9. Project Team. Our project team is headed by a project \nmanager. Five people report to the project manager.\nAvoid restating the obvious. Interpret the information  \nin the graphic. Tell the evaluator why, as shown in the  \nfollowing example: \nFigure 10. Proven Team Organization. Our project team will be \nstructured as shown, based on the lessons learned from numerous \nsimilar previous projects. Our team is managed by a single, on-site \nproject manager with five direct reports. \nFigure 1 below shows a single-word title as the original and a \nmodel action caption in the revised version.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n20\n©Shipley Associates\n4 \t CONNECT A CUSTOMER BENEFIT TO THE FEATURE DEPICTED IN THE GRAPHIC.\nFollowing a basic principle of good organization, begin with \nthe most important point to the evaluator. Captions that lead \nwith the benefit are more customer-focused than captions \nthat lead with the feature. Benefits \nattract the customer’s attention. \nFeatures support how the benefit is \ndelivered. However, do not get overly \nconcerned if the feature precedes the \nbenefit. Captions comprising a few \nsentences are short enough that the evaluator will likely see \nthe connection.\nIf you are struggling to identify the customer benefit, you \nhave two possibilities:\n1.\t You offer no customer benefit. Remove the graphic and \ncaption from your proposal.\n2.\t You do not know what benefits the customer is seeking. \nPerhaps you should not waste your time and resources \nbidding.\nA caption should contain benefits \nand features and make a clear, \nplausible connection:\nFigure 13. Cost-Effective Cloud Server. Our in-house design makes \nthe Cloud Server a low-cost option. \nNothing in the caption makes a plausible connection. An in-\nhouse design could just as easily increase the cost. Improve \nthe caption by specifying what feature of the in-house design \nleads to the lower cost. Review the captions in guideline 1 for \nbetter examples.\nDuring proposal preparation, ask \nwriters to draft and retain full action \ncaptions in their section text files. If \nwriters prepare their own graphics \nto any degree, ask them to keep all \ngraphics in a separate file, labeled \nwith the detailed section number and \nthe graphic numbered sequentially \nwithin the section. The person or persons assigned to produce \nthe proposal are better equipped to insert graphics and \ncaptions consistently and efficiently into the final document.\nThe best way to develop a library of graphics and captions is to \ncollect them from each proposal. Place them in a repository or \nlibrary that can be accessed by proposal writers and graphics \nsupport. A best practice is to develop an indexing and retrieval \nsystem that is searchable by key words and an identifying \nnumber. Maintain a link between each graphic and potential \ncaptions.\nIf graphics might be reused, place and retain a unique \nidentifying number with each proposal graphic to facilitate \nretrieval. Assign a revision number whenever the graphic is \nmodified. To avoid distracting readers, orient the identifying \nnumber vertically to the graphic in approximately 6-point type \nin the same position relative to each graphic. \nHere is another tip to evaluate the captions in a proposal: \nExtract and print all captions in the proposal. If the captions do \nnot summarize your proposal and tell a persuasive story, they \nneed more words and usually more benefits.\nStandard graphics can often be used effectively to make a \nselling point if the action caption is tailored to each proposal \nopportunity. When boilerplate or stock graphics are kept with \ntheir action captions in the same file, read the action caption \nbefore placing the graphic in the proposal. If needed, tailor the \naction caption to the opportunity.\nAction captions are similar \nto theme statements in \nstructure. Both link bene-\nfits and features. Both are \nstronger when the benefit \nprecedes the feature.\nSee GRAPHICS and \nTHEME STATEMENTS.\nOrganizations that \nproduce numerous \nproposals for similar \nproducts or services \noften maintain a \nlibrary file of graphics \nand action captions. \nRetrieval is easier, but \ncaptions filed as part \nof the graphic are less \nlikely to be tailored to \nthe opportunity.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n21\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nQUANTIFY THE BENEFIT, IF POSSIBLE.\nCaptions, like theme statements, are more credible when the \nbenefit is quantified and substantiated. Compare the following \nexamples:\nWeaker, unquantified action caption\nFigure 8-12. Flexible Voice Messaging System. Our low-cost solution \nis due to the graphic operator interface and advanced networking \nsoftware.\nStronger, quantified action caption\nFigure 8-12. Flexible Voice Messaging System. Users have docu-\nmented average operating cost reductions of 17 percent due to the \ngraphic operator interface and advanced networking software.\nThe second example is also more specific, citing the average \noperating cost reductions versus the more general low-cost \nsolution.\nMuch like a value proposition, quantified \nbenefits are more credible when the \nsubstantiation, usually supplied in \nsupporting text, includes more of the \nfollowing elements:\n•\t Specific. States what is to be purchased.\n•\t Measurable. Tells how much will be purchased.\n•\t Timed. Cites the timing of the purchase and the savings \nor benefits.\n•\t Results-Oriented. States the result quantitatively, if \npossible.\nQuantify benefits only when you can support your claim. It’s \nbetter to have a benefit unquantified than to lose credibility \nwith customers.\n6\t\nPLACE ACTION CAPTIONS BELOW THE GRAPHIC.\nIn Western society, most readers read from top-to-bottom, \nleft-to-right. An evaluator who spots a graphic will tend to first \nlook below the graphic for the explanation. Normal practice for \nmost publications is to place the caption below the graphic.\nIn the more sophisticated designs found in some magazines, \njournals, and books, the caption may be placed above or to \none side of the graphic. However, the designer will still usually \nfollow the principle of graphic association: The caption is \nplaced closer to the edge of the graphic than to any other \nitem on the page, causing the reader to associate them. \nThe principle of graphic association is illustrated in figure 2, \napplied to captions.\nIn rapid-response proposal efforts, keep things consistent \n and simple. Place the caption in the same location relative  \nto the graphic, preferably below, unless you are severely  \npage limited.\nFigure 2. Camp Activities. Youth enrolled in the Summer \nAdventure Camp have access to our private lake and enjoy a \nvariety of supervised water activities. Available equipment at \nthe lake includes canoes, a rope swing, and a zipline. \nSee THEME \nSTATEMENTS.\n\nAction Captions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n22\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nREFERENCE ALL GRAPHICS BY FIGURE NUMBER IN PRECEDING TEXT.\nAll graphics, with their action captions, should stand alone. \nThe evaluator must be able to get the point that you intended \nwithout having to read the body text.\nYet, always refer to the graphic in the body text before it \nappears in the proposal. The approaches shown below are \nequally acceptable.\nSome of the reasons our voice messaging system is so flexible are \nshown in figure 3-12.\nFigure 3-12 shows why our voice messaging system is so flexible.\nPlace the graphic on the same or facing page to enable the \nevaluator to see the graphic without having to turn the page. \nChange the section organization if necessary, rather than force \nthe evaluator to search for the graphic. Often evaluators do not \nsearch, and your point is lost. \n8\t\nUSE A DIFFERENT TYPEFACE OR STYLE FOR THE FIGURE TITLE, THE CAPTION, \nAND THE BODY TEXT OF THE PROPOSAL.\nAction captions are the theme statements for the graphics. Use \na different typeface or style to emphasize and differentiate the \ncaption from body text. Because captions contain key selling \npoints, the change of style increases the chance they will be \nread and remembered. Captions include the figure number, \nthe figure title, and the explanatory text. \nDifferent caption styles are acceptable for different proposals. \nSelect a style for each proposal and be consistent. Most \norganizations adopt a consistent style for all proposals unless \nthe style is specified in the bid request.\nUsing bold for the figure number and figure \ntitle draws the reader to the beginning of the \ncaption. Informative titles create interest, enticing the reader \nto read the text in the caption. This convention is illustrated in \nthis Proposal Guide.\nWhile action caption styles may vary, consistently follow these \nguidelines:\nIn captions, the word figure should be capitalized. However, \nwhen referring to graphics in the text, even if you refer to a \nspecific figure, do not capitalize figure unless it begins  \na sentence: \nAs shown in figure 12, . . . \nOur project team organization is shown in figure 3–4. \nFigure 3–4 shows our project team organization.\nUse periods following captions that are complete sentences \nbut not after captions that are incomplete sentences. If your \ncaptions mix complete and incomplete sentences, end all \ncaptions with periods.\nThe style of punctuation between the figure number, figure \ntitle, and caption text may vary. While all the examples shown \nbelow are acceptable, the first is cleanest while the last \nexample is the least preferred.\nFigure 3–12. Flexible Voice Messaging System. Our low-cost        \nsolution is due to the graphic operator interface and advanced net-\nworking software.\nFigure 3–12: Flexible Voice Messaging System.

Passive voice tends to create longer sentences. \nDecreasing unnecessary passive voice will shorten proposal \nsections and be more persuasive.\nActive voice is emphatic, decisive, and accepts responsibility \nfor action. Passive voice weakens your message by evading \nresponsibility and distancing you from your customer. The \ndifferences in form of active and passive voices are fairly easy \nto see.\nActive sentences generally have three elements, usually in this \nfamiliar order:\nSimply stated, A does something or acts upon B. Consider the \nfollowing active sentence:\nOur project manager (A) emails (does) a project status report (B).\nIn passive sentences, however:\nSimply stated, B is acted upon by A. The example sentence \nstated passively becomes:\nThe project status report (B) is emailed (is acted upon) by our project \nmanager (A). \nThe weakest passive sentences omit the actor. Simply stated, B \nis acted upon. The example sentence then reads:\nThe project status report (B) is emailed (is acted upon).\nThe active voice construction places the project manager first \nand accepts responsibility, giving the sentence greater clarity, \nemphasis, and credibility. The passive structure places the \nreport first, leaves the project manager out completely, and \nthus evades responsibility. \nActive and passive voice sentences both convey action, but active voice sentences are more persuasive, decisive, and confident. \nUse active voice unless you have a good reason to choose passive voice. \n1\n2\n3\nAn actor doing an action\nA verb describing the action\nA recipient being acted upon \nor receiving the action\n1\n2\n3\nThe recipient takes the actor’s place\nThe verb changes form and needs \nan additional helping verb\nThe actor is introduced in a \n“by” phrase or is omitted\n\nActive/Passive Voice\nShipley Proposal Guide\n25\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nUSE ACTIVE SENTENCES UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON  \nTO CHOOSE PASSIVE.\nRemember that:\n•\t In active voice, the subject acts.\n•\t In passive voice, the subject is acted upon.\nThe most important reason to use active voice in sales \ndocuments is to be more convincing and persuasive. \nCustomers are less interested in awarding a contract to an \norganization or person that seems weak-willed, evasive, or \nindecisive. Customers want the bidder to accept responsibility, \nmake things happen, appear confident, meet requirements, \nand solve their problems.\nPublic figures often use passive voice:\nThe brief was filed yesterday.\nMistakes were made.\nNo one is responsible, least of all the speaker. The speaker \nappears to be an innocent bystander.\nCompare the passive and active examples in \nfigure 1. The active sentences name the actors and are more \nconcise. The writing is clearer and more confident.\nWriters sometimes inadvertently give life or action to \ninanimate objects, as in the fourth example in figure 1. The \nsentence is concise but inaccurate. The breathalyzer test does \nnot act, the police officer does.\nUse active voice when you want to emphasize the actor. If you \nneed to emphasize the recipient or omit the actor, then use \npassive voice. Passive sentences can be useful in proposals, \ndepending upon your situation and strategy, as discussed in \nguidelines 2–4.\nPASSIVE\nACTIVE\nThe baseline assessment data will be solicited in a telephone \nsurvey.\nAssessors will solicit baseline data by telephone.\nMonthly progress reports, key milestone reports, and a compre-\nhensive final report will be submitted.\nOur project manager will submit monthly progress reports, key \nmilestone reports, and a comprehensive final report.\nBD-CMM® can be used to determine how to extend the organiza-\ntion’s current business development capabilities.\nManagement can use BD-CMM® to determine how to extend  \ncurrent business development capabilities.\nBreathalyzer tests determine drivers’ blood alcohol levels.\nPolice officers use breathalyzer tests to determine drivers’ blood \nalcohol levels.\nAfter the contract is signed, excavation will begin.\nWe will begin excavation after we sign the contract.\nFigure 1. Examples of Passive and Active Sentences. The active sentences are clearer and more persuasive. In the first example, the active \nsentence names the actor and is more concise. In the second active example, the project manager takes responsibility for the reports. In the \nthird example, we know who will use the BD-CMM. The fourth example states who you do not want to see if you drink and drive. The fifth exam-\nple clearly states who will begin excavation.\nSee STYLE \nAND TONE.\nUse active sentences unless you have a good reason \nto choose passive.\nUse a passive sentence when you do not know or do \nnot want to mention the actor.\nUse a passive sentence when the receiver is more \nimportant than the actor.\nUse a passive construction to clearly \nlink two sentences.\nUse personal pronouns and active voice to \nconvey responsibility and clarity.\nConvert passive sentences to active by rethinking, \nreordering, and rewording the sentence.\n4\n5\n6\nACTIVE/PASSIVE VOICE\n1\n2\n3\n\nActive/Passive Voice\nShipley Proposal Guide\n26\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nUSE A PASSIVE SENTENCE WHEN THE RECEIVER IS MORE  \nIMPORTANT THAN THE ACTOR.\nThe opening or beginning of a sentence gets the most \nemphasis. Use a passive construction if you want to emphasize \nthe customer benefits over the person or organization that \ndelivers those benefits. In this instance, passive voice can \nimprove the customer focus of the sentence.\nActive voice, placing the feature before the benefit\nJenair securely attaches non-destructible assembly instructions and \ntools to the aircraft beneath the instrument panel to simplify fast and \naccurate field assembly of the aircraft. \nPassive voice, placing the benefit before the feature\nTo simplify fast and accurate field assembly, non-destructible \nassembly instructions and tools are securely attached to the aircraft \nbeneath the instrument panel at the Jenair factory.\nHowever, passive construction is not the only option. The \nsentence could be reworded to emphasize the person doing \nthe field assembly instead of the factory assembly.\nActive voice, changing the actor and placing the benefit first\nSoldiers can rapidly and accurately field-assemble the aircraft using \nthe non-destructible assembly instructions and tools that are perma-\nnently attached to the aircraft beneath the instrument panel.\nWho attaches the instructions (Jenair) and where (at the Jenair \nfactory) are implicit and relatively less important than the \nbenefits to the soldiers.\n4\t\nUSE A PASSIVE CONSTRUCTION TO CLEARLY LINK TWO SENTENCES.\nOccasionally, two sentences are linked so that key words \nare easily connected. In the following example, the second \nsentence is passive. The words “work packages” are \ndeliberately repeated and placed close together to clarify the \nconnection. \nOur Integrated Master Plan is composed of individual work packages. \nEach work package is linked to the Integrated Master Schedule and \nmonitored by the program manager.\nThe active version is harder to comprehend.\nOur Integrated Master Plan is composed of individual work packages. \nThe program manager monitors each work package that is linked to \nthe Integrated Master Schedule.\nMaking the second sentence passive smooths the transition \nand improves clarity.\n2\t\nUSE A PASSIVE SENTENCE WHEN YOU DO NOT KNOW OR DO NOT WANT  \nTO MENTION THE ACTOR.\nIndividuals make errors; organizations own errors. Avoid \nnaming the actor to avoid blaming an individual. Avoid \nnaming your organization as causing a problem if you want to \nemphasize the lessons learned from the experience.\nNo individual or organization named\nThe monthly status report did not arrive, but it could not be deter-\nmined whether it had been misaddressed, misdirected, or misplaced.\nAvoids naming responsible individual(s)\nThe network was deactivated for three hours.\nThe organization avoids responsibility\nThe distribution center construction was not completed on time \nbecause four weeks of unseasonably severe weather were not antici-\npated.\n\nActive/Passive Voice\nShipley Proposal Guide\n27\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nUSE PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND ACTIVE VOICE TO CONVEY  \nRESPONSIBILITY AND CLARITY.\nPersonal pronouns establish a personal, human tone. Personal \npronouns commonly replace names of individuals or objects. \nI, we\t\nfirst-person\nyou\t\nsecond-person\nhe, she, it, they\t\nthird-person\nPersonal pronouns are preferred in proposals, as long as the \nidentity of the person, team, or object is clear to the reader. \nRepeat the name if you think readers might not grasp the \nspecific noun. \n“We” and “our” are acceptable and preferred alternatives to \nslavishly repeating the name of your organization throughout \nyour proposal.\n“We” and “our” are equally acceptable and preferred when \nreferring to teams. If you must refer to a team member, name \nthe member. Use the same approach for teams comprising \nmultiple divisions of a single organization or different \norganizations.

For example, \nthe British Ministry of \nDefence often uses annex \ninstead of appendix for \nsimilar types of material.\nAPPENDICES\nUse appendices, attachments, and annexes to \nstreamline your proposal.\nLimit appended material specifically to the \ninformation requested by the customer.\n1\n2\nTreat requests for additional material \nas a sales opportunity.\nRefer to all appendices, attachments, and \nannexes in the main body of your proposal.\n3\n4\nWebster’s Dictionary, 14th Edition  \ndefines the following words as \nshown: \n•\t Annex: section added to a docu-\nment addendum\n•\t Appendix: additional or supple-\nmental material added at the \nend of a document\n•\t Attachment: anything added or \nattached\nAppendices, attachments, and annexes are seen as similar by casual business readers but might have specific and different \nmeanings to evaluators. Because each customer’s meaning prevails, confirm that your understanding matches the customer’s.\n\nAppendices\nShipley Proposal Guide\n30\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nLIMIT APPENDED MATERIAL SPECIFICALLY TO THE INFORMATION REQUESTED \nBY THE CUSTOMER.\nIf the customer did not ask for the information, leave it out. \nProposal writers sometimes take the supermarket approach \nto proposal writing. That is, “They might not know we offer a \nsuper widget, so let’s tell them all about it. We might get lucky.”\nInstead, include a statement like the following:\nTo make your evaluation easier, we have limited our response to the \nspecific items that you requested. Should you need additional infor-\nmation on these or any other services, please contact . . .\nList the additional information that you have available and \nwho to contact to obtain the information. Intentionally limiting \nappended material eliminates the cost of gathering, preparing, \nand producing material that is seldom read.\nIf additional material is requested as a result of the evaluation, \nyou can prepare it outside the submittal deadline, leaving \nmore time to devote to the parts of your proposal that are \nmore important.\n3\t\nTREAT REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AS A SALES OPPORTUNITY.\nIn many competitions, seller-customer contact is prohibited \nduring the formal response period. If not, treat customer \nquestions and requests for additional material as a sales \nopportunity while competitors are locked out.\nWhen additional material is requested, make sure you \nunderstand the request, prepare it quickly and concisely, then \npresent it personally, if possible. Exploit any opportunity to \nrelate to the customer.\n4\t\nREFER TO ALL APPENDICES, ATTACHMENTS, AND ANNEXES IN THE MAIN BODY \nOF YOUR PROPOSAL.\nInclude short, informative \nsummaries of the content of each \nappendix to tell evaluators what \nthey contain:\nAttachment A contains our last three annual reports, as requested in \nyour RFP. \nIf the appendix is extensive, draft a paragraph that summarizes \nthe key points and previews the content. Most readers will \naccept your summary and will not read any part of the \nattachment.\nThe prior example could be strengthened if necessary to \nsupport a key selling point:\nAttachment A contains our last three annual reports, as requested in \nyour RFP. The 50 percent annual increase in sales over the past 3 years \ndemonstrates the increased demand for our services. Please note \nthe stability of our management and financial performance, further \nsupporting our low-risk approach.\nSee ORGANIZATION for a \nbetter understanding of the \nimportance of providing a \nsummary of appendices.\n1 \t\nUSE APPENDICES, ATTACHMENTS, AND ANNEXES TO STREAMLINE  \nYOUR PROPOSAL.\nIn a proposal, assess whether the information is of interest \nto evaluators with differing backgrounds. Because most \nproposals consist of responses to a customer’s \nquestions, provide a summary answer to each \nquestion followed by support. If the support \nis extensive yet needed in the proposal, then \nconsider relegating it to an appendix.\nIf your proposal sections begin with a number, letter the \nappendices. The reverse applies. \nShort proposals are much more likely to be read, especially \nby senior influencers and decision makers. Government \nevaluators do not have to evaluate unsolicited material.\nSee QUESTION/ \nRESPONSE  \nPROPOSALS.\n\nBid Decisions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n31\n©Shipley Associates\nBID DECISIONS\nBid decisions are reviews often triggered by customer actions \nat which management determines whether to advance, defer, \nor end the pursuit. \nBid decisions hinge on whether you have the capability or can \nobtain the resources to pursue and subsequently capture an \nopportunity. Bid decisions also evaluate if the likelihood of \nwinning the opportunity is too low to justify pursuit.\nThree distinct bid decision milestones include pursuit, bid, \nand bid validation.\nA positive pursuit decision initiates preparation of the \ncapture/opportunity plan. A positive bid decision initiates \npreparation of the proposal plan. A positive bid validation \ndecision initiates the final proposal kickoff meeting and the \nfull proposal preparation process.\nImproving your bid decision discipline is one of the most \neffective ways to improve win rates. Bid discipline can double \nor triple win rates.\nIf the decision is a no-bid, explain the decision to the  \ncustomer in a manner that enhances your future or  \nimmediate position. Strengthen your future position by  \nciting why your organization is unable to meet the \nrequirements, quality standards, or expectations of either  \nthe customer’s or your organization.\nIn these examples, the seller seeks to modify the bid \nrequirements when notifying the customer:\nWe are unable to prepare the quality solution and proposal that you \nexpect by April 1, but we can prepare a quality bid if you extend the \nproposal due date to April 15.\nWe cannot manufacture and deliver ten systems within 6 months \ndue to prior customer commitments. If you can accept delivery of 3 \nsystems per month, commencing in month 4, we can submit a com-\npetitive bid.\nAn individual’s bid recommendation \nis often influenced by job function. \nProposal professionals focus on the \nimmediate proposal—not bidding \non losers eliminates wasted work.\nSales professionals often see \nproposals prepared by someone else as “free.” The win rate on \nno-bids is zero, the win rate on the worst submittal is greater \nthan zero, so what’s to lose? \nOften, only senior management can balance the benefits, \nprobability of winning, risks, direct bid costs, opportunity \ncosts, and differing recommendations. \nFor a better perspective on \nbusiness development  \nprocess milestones, \nsee PROCESS and  \nDECISION GATE REVIEWS, \nCapture Guide.\nBid decisions are aimed at eliminating opportunities or sales leads that you have a low probability of winning, permitting \ngreater focus on opportunities that can be won. Consider splitting the bid decision into three distinct milestones: pursuit, bid, \nand bid validation.\n\nBid Decisions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n32\n©Shipley Associates\nBID DECISIONS\nUse the pursuit decision to verify the opportunity fits \nyour strategic direction and capability and to initiate \nfurther planning.\nUse the preliminary bid decision to verify you are \npositioned to win before committing to an expensive \nproposal effort.\nUse the bid validation decision to ensure show \nstoppers are addressed.\n1\n2\n3\nEstablish clear inputs, outputs, and \nresponsibilities for each decision milestone.\nMake all bid decisions early.\nTailor the bid decision process to your \norganization and the value of the opportunity.\n4\n5\n6\n1\t\nUSE THE PURSUIT DECISION TO VERIFY THE OPPORTUNITY FITS YOUR  \nSTRATEGIC DIRECTION AND CAPABILITY AND TO INITIATE FURTHER PLANNING.\nUse compatibility grids, checklists, weighted matrices,  \nand decision trees to improve bid decisions. While tools  \nwill not make your decision, they often highlight what you  \ndo not know.\nA positive pursuit decision initiates \ncapture planning and preparation of \nthe capture plan.\nPlot opportunities on a grid according to their relative match \nwith existing products and services on one axis and existing \nmarkets and customers on the other axis. \nThe plot highlights opportunities outside your core business \nthat often carry higher risk. Typical questions for a pursuit \ndecision checklist include the following:\n•\t Is the opportunity within our business area?\n•\t Does the opportunity fit within our strategic plan?\n•\t To what extent are we known to the customer?\n•\t Has the customer budgeted for the purchase?\n•\t Do we have local representation?\n•\t Who created the customer’s vision for potential solutions?\n•\t Do we understand who has the decision power and \ninfluence?\n•\t Do we have any current or potential coaches or sponsors \nin the customer’s organization?\n•\t Is there an incumbent? Are the incumbent or others \nalready favored?\n•\t Do we have any competitive advantage, discriminators, or \nvalue-added aspects?\n•\t How will the opportunity affect our existing business, \npositively or negatively?\n•\t What resources are required for capture and are they \navailable?\n•\t What are the risks of bidding? Or not bidding?\n•\t Can we win? How or why could we lose?\n•\t Is the opportunity potentially profitable short-term or \nlong-term?\nSee CAPTURE  \nPLANNING; SECTION 2.8, \nBusiness Development \nLifecycle Guide.\n\nBid Decisions\nShipley Proposal Guide\n33\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 1.

Because industry averages show that 20 percent of bid \nand proposal (B&P) funds are spent from pursuit to the bid \nmilestone, a positive pursuit decision is essentially authorizing \n20 percent of the opportunity’s B&P funds for pre-proposal \nactivities. A generic risk grid is shown in figure 1. \n2\t\nUSE THE PRELIMINARY BID DECISION TO VERIFY YOU ARE POSITIONED TO WIN \nBEFORE COMMITTING TO AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSAL EFFORT.\nMany of the questions asked at the preliminary bid milestone \nare similar to those listed under the pursuit milestone, except \ndecision makers expect a more detailed response. \nA positive preliminary bid decision initiates preparation of the \nproposal management plan.\nAfter spending pre-proposal money on positioning activities, \nhow successful were you? Consider adding these questions to \nthe earlier list:\n•\t To what extent have we influenced the customer’s \nrequirements?\n•\t Does the customer rely on us for input and help?\n•\t Do we know the competitors and their likely approach?\n•\t Are there any surprises in the draft requirements? Do we \nknow why?\nAnother approach is to use a bid decision \ntree like the one shown in figure 2. The usual \nproblem with decision trees is what to do \nwhen the answer is not a clear yes or no.\nSome opportunities are won despite negative \nindicators that suggested a no-bid decision. \nIgnoring no-bid indicators increases the risk of losing.

Establishing a set time to consider all bid decisions \nlets everyone know what is required to get an early decision. \nBid decisions tentatively conveyed to the proposal team lead \nto halfhearted efforts. \nIn one competition, a major systems company had delayed the \nbid decision. They had assigned ten section leads, giving them \ndesks in a large bid preparation room. Seldom were more than \nfour desks occupied. None of the section leads thought they \nwould really submit a bid. This resulted in tremendous waste \nof time, energy, and money.\n6\t\nTAILOR THE BID DECISION PROCESS TO YOUR ORGANIZATION AND THE VALUE  \nOF THE OPPORTUNITY.\nOrganizations with a short sales cycle usually consolidate the \nbid and bid validation into one milestone. When the sales cycle \nis 5 to 10 days, compensate by establishing and managing to \nexplicit pursuit and bid parameters.\nOrganizations lacking clear bid parameters and management \noversight exhibit excessive, unproductive proposal activity.\nBusiness capture effectiveness improves when decision \nauthority is clear and proportional to the value of the \nopportunity. Value is a function of the size, profitability, \nstrategy, and follow-on potential of the opportunity.\n\nCapture/Opportunity Planning\nShipley Proposal Guide\n37\n©Shipley Associates\nCAPTURE/OPPORTUNITY PLANNING\nThe aim of capture (opportunity) planning is to position the \ncustomer to prefer your organization and your solution to the \nexclusion of all competitors or to at least prefer you prior to \nany proposals being submitted. \nSome organizations use the terms capture plan and \nopportunity plan interchangeably. \nCapture planning is an opportunity-specific process following \nthe pursuit decision gate milestone that continues in parallel \nwith proposal planning and preparation until the opportunity \nis awarded. \nAssign an individual to the capture (opportunity) manager role \nwith the responsibility to win the opportunity, manage the \ncapture planning process, and manage the capture team. This \nteam can comprise the capture manager, program manager, \nand proposal manager. Note that roles are not necessarily \npositions, and an individual might assume multiple roles and \nsupport multiple opportunities.\nEnvision a capture plan as \na framework, a series of \nfolders or buckets where the \ncapture manager assembles \nand organizes opportunity-\nspecific data by topic. While \nthe original capture plan was a written document, many \norganizations have evolved to presentation formats to \nfacilitate collaborative reviews and updates and web-browser \nformats to facilitate collaborative development and sharing \namong virtual teams.\nThis topic is written from the \nperspective of a \nproposal manager who is \nNOT concurrently assigned \nto the capture manager role. \nFor an in-depth understand-\ning of capture planning,  \nrefer to the Shipley Capture \nGuide.\nSee BID DECISIONS and \nPROCESS; PHASE 3,  \nBusiness Development  \nLifecycle Guide.\nCapture/opportunity planning is the process of identifying opportunities, assessing the competitive environment, and \nimplementing winning strategies oriented toward capturing a specific business opportunity. Consistent, successful planning \nrequires a written, action-oriented capture/opportunity plan.\nDifferent organizations may \nuse capture and opportunity \ninterchangeably to describe \ncapturing business. For \nsimplicity, the Proposal Guide \nuses the term “capture.”\nCAPTURE/OPPORTUNITY PLANNING\nAdvocate a capture/opportunity planning discipline \nto capture new business more efficiently.\n1\nUse the capture/opportunity plan to jump-\nstart the proposal planning process.\n2\n\nCapture/Opportunity Planning\nShipley Proposal Guide\n38\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nADVOCATE A CAPTURE/OPPORTUNITY PLANNING DISCIPLINE TO CAPTURE NEW \nBUSINESS MORE EFFICIENTLY.\nCapture planning offers benefits to everyone involved:\n•\t Sales and business development professionals who \norchestrate organizational resources use the capture plan \nto specify the needed positioning actions.\n•\t Senior managers have a mechanism to leverage limited \nbusiness development resources to most efficiently win \nbusiness.\n•\t Proposal managers slash proposal planning time, \nimprove proposal quality and efficiency, and increase   \nwin rates.\n•\t Participants stay committed, knowing their efforts are \nnot being wasted. \nThe capture plan is typically part \nof the business development and \nplanning process, as illustrated in \nfigure 1. Capture planning is iterative and constantly changing \nas new information is obtained.\nBusiness capture efficiency and effectiveness are improved \nwhen all employees have consistent information and \ncommunicate consistent messages to customers. Much of the \ninformation in one plan can be reused in subsequent plans.\nSee SAMPLE TEMPLATES \n1-2, Capture Guide.\n30%\n40%\n20%\n60%\n30%\nMulti-Year\nStrategic  \nPlan\n%\n40%\nMarketing/\nCampaign \nPlan\n60\nCapture/\nOpportunity  \nPlan\n%\nProposal \nManagement\n Plan\n%\nClosure/\nImplementation \nPlan\n10%\nFigure 1. Capture/Opportunity Planning Improves Sales Efficiency. \nMuch of the data in each plan can be reused; it transfers or flows into \nthe next plan. While the estimates vary, approximately 60 percent \nof the capture plan data is needed and reused in the proposal \nmanagement plan.\n2\t\nUSE THE CAPTURE/OPPORTUNITY PLAN TO JUMP-START THE PROPOSAL     \nPLANNING PROCESS.\nRelying on the capture plan to quickly prepare the initial \nproposal management plan both saves time and presents \na consistent message to the customer. In the absence of a \ncapture plan, the newly assigned proposal manager starts \nfrom scratch, often with little help and under severe time \nconstraints.\nCapture plans and proposal management \nplans have the common elements illustrated \nin figure 2. Information on the customer, the \nrequirements, and competitors transfers \ndirectly. The capture strategy needs to be extended or \nconverted into a proposal strategy. Only the proposal outline, \nproposal preparation schedule, and the writers’ packages \nneed to be created once an effective capture plan is in place.\nSee WIN \nSTRATEGY \nDEVELOPMENT, \nCapture Guide.\nProposal\nManagement\n Plan\nWriter’s Pkg.\nSchedule\nOutline\nCompliance \nChecklist\nStrategy\nRequirements\nCustomer\nCapture/\nOpportunity  \nPlan\nCustomer\nRequirements\nStrategy\nFigure 2. Base Proposal Management Plan on the Capture Plan. \nA current capture plan effectively front-loads the proposal man-\nagement plan. With approximately 60 percent of the information \ntransferring from the capture plan, convert the capture strategy to a \nproposal strategy and add proposal-specific material from the bid re-\nquest. Because the proposal submittal date is set by the customer, a \nshorter planning interval prior to kickoff leaves more time to develop \na winning proposal.\n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n39\n©Shipley Associates\nCHOOSING CORRECT WORDS\nGood writers are always looking for resources to improve their \nwriting and word usage. Proposal writers often ask, “Can you \ngive me some good words I can use in my proposals?”\nNo magic formula will turn your sales documents into models \nof effective persuasion. However, the following guidelines will \nhelp you improve your ability to write persuasively.\nChoosing correct words is important. Selecting the wrong \nword has several negative impacts in sales documents:\n•\t Readers question your literacy. If you seem illiterate, then \nyour facts might also be questionable.\n•\t Readers question your ability to be a successful \ncontractor. If you cannot communicate clearly in your \nproposal, perhaps you cannot communicate clearly on \nthe proposed project.\n•\t You increase your project risk when using incorrect or \nimprecise words in legal documents. Courts tend to \nsupport the words on the page, not what the author \nclaims to have intended.\nA broad range of word problems is discussed in this section. \nChoosing incorrect words reduces the persuasiveness of your \nsales documents. Worse yet, incorrect words can increase \nyour risk, turning a profitable opportunity into a loss and a \ncustomer into a competitor’s customer. Writers and editors \nmust recognize and choose correct words. \nChoosing correct words makes sales documents more persuasive, effective, and easier to read. Common word problems include \nwordy phrases, incorrect words, and words with more than one meaning. \nCHOOSING CORRECT WORDS\nSimplify or replace long words and wordy phrases.\nUse the correct word in context.\nUse the same words in the same context.\n1\n2\n3\nRevise words or phrases that could have \nmore than one meaning.\n4\nReplace nominals with verbs or adjectives to \nmake sentences more direct, more concise, and \neasier to read.\nUse precise, powerful, descriptive verbs. \nUse grabbers, transitions, and clinchers effectively and \nappropriately in your proposals and presentations.\n5\n6\n7\nAvoid words and phrases that increase contract risk.\n8\n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n40\n©Shipley Associates\nUse small words. Simplicity counts. Long words tend to raise \nsuspicions. The more simply an idea is presented, the more \nunderstandable and credible to more people.\nReplace long words with shorter words \nif they have the same meaning. Just \nbecause utilize has more letters than \nuse does not mean you are smarter. \nWordy phrases use too many words to express an idea and are \nsimilar to redundant words, gobblekygook, and cliches. While \ngobbledygook is unintelligible, wordy phrases can often be \nunderstood. Overuse often turns a wordy phrase into a cliche.\nConfirming our conversation . . .\nPlease do not hesitate to call.\nWe are pleased to present our proposal for . . .\nThank you for the opportunity to present our proposal for . . .\nAt best, wordy phrases are clumsy and obscure meaning. \nAt worst, they deemphasize or hide key ideas and prompt \ncustomers to tune out and select another bidder.\nCommon wordy phrases and recommended replacements are \nlisted in figure 1. \nSee CLICHES, JARGON, \nGOBBLEDYGOOK, and \nREDUNDANT WORDS.\n1\t\nSIMPLIFY OR REPLACE LONG WORDS AND WORDY

Some Wordy Phrases with Simplifications.

A few, but not all, of \nthe word-pairs commonly misused in proposals are listed in \nfigure 2. Please refer to a style guide for additional examples, \npreferably one prepared for business writers.\nWords are often out of context in proposals due to different \neducation, work experiences, and culture of writers \nand readers. Education and work experience affect our \nunderstanding of words.\nAcronyms can be misunderstood:\nATM  =\t\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode\n\t\nAutomated Teller Machine\n\t\nAir Traffic Management\nJargon can be used out of context:\nConsideration: After due consideration, we will complete the project.\nA layman might interpret consideration as meaning \ncareful thought. A lawyer might interpret \nconsideration to mean payment.\nCultural differences lead to the phrase that refers to the United \nKingdom and the United States as, “Two countries divided by a \ncommon language.” Native speakers from France and Canada \nuse French differently. Spanish varies greatly among Spain and \nnumerous Central and South American countries. The same \napplies to Portuguese spoken in Portugal and Brazil.\nConfusion may result from English speakers who adopt words \nfrom other languages. The original meaning in either language \nmay change over time. Further confusion results from words \nthat sound and may even be spelled identically but have \nradically different meanings. \nIf you use a word that may be misinterpreted, be sure the \nsurrounding context clarifies your intended meaning.\nSee INTERNATIONAL \nPROPOSALS.\n3\t\nUSE THE SAME WORDS IN THE SAME CONTEXT.\nConsistency matters. Use the same word repeatedly—you will \nbe less confusing and more likely be remembered.\nEducators emphasize repetition because it is effective. \nAdvertisers emphasize repetition because it is effective. \nEmulate them.\nChanging the word or introducing a synonym for variety \nfrequently confuses the reader or listener. Readers skim, and \nlisteners tune out. You might be sick of the word or phrase, \nespecially if you have multiple revisions and rehearsals,  \nbut your audience might be hearing it for the \nfirst time. \nUsing different words with the same meaning is a style  \nchoice that might demonstrate your intelligence. However, \nreaders and listeners might perceive it as an arrogant and  \noff-putting tone.\nSee STYLE \nAND TONE.\n4\t\nREVISE WORDS OR PHRASES THAT COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE MEANING.\nWords or phrases can have different meanings due to context \nor honest misunderstanding. The following examples illustrate \nconfusing, multiple meanings.\n1.\t Using a word out of context.\nFederal Bank can speed data transfer among branches with a \nmodern ATM network.\nBank executives accustomed to ATM meaning \nautomated teller machines might be confused about a \ntelecommunications proposal referring to networks using \nasynchronous transfer mode protocol.\n2.\t Correctly using a

Choose the Correct Word to Improve Readability. While far from complete, many of the words misused in sales documents are \nlisted above. Please refer to a quality style guide or dictionary for a more exhaustive list and more extensive guidance. Note: Rather than listing \nin alphabetical order, words with similar meanings are grouped.\nThe ambiguous bi- can mean either twice within a time period \nor every other time period. Semimonthly has always meant \ntwice a month but suffers from confusion associated with \nbimonthly. Avoid the confusion by saying twice a month or \nevery other month.\nFigure 2 lists frequently confused words. If you suspect that \nyour customer could misunderstand the meaning, use a word \nor phrase that cannot be misunderstood. Being clear can keep \nyou in the competition and out of court.\n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n43\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nREPLACE NOMINALS WITH VERBS OR ADJECTIVES TO MAKE SENTENCES MORE \nDIRECT, MORE CONCISE, AND EASIER TO READ.\nA nominal is a word or group of words that function as a noun. \nMany proposal writers turn verbs into nouns, making the \nsentence more distant from the reader. For example, “We had \na proposal team meeting,” is less direct and concise than, “Our \nproposal team met.”\nVerbs are the most powerful and direct part of speech. Make \nyour proposal writing more powerful, more efficient, and \neasier to read by using verbs or adjectives to make your point, \nrather than nominals. \nConverting prepositional phrases to adjectives is another way \nto make your sentences more direct and concise. Position the \nadjective in front of the noun and eliminate the preposition.\nThe examples in figure 3 show how statements become more \npowerful when nouns are replaced by adjectives, and when \nadjectives are replaced by verbs.\nPOOR EXAMPLE\nBETTER/BEST EXAMPLE\nOur project manager is the point of contact for new \ntask orders. (noun phrase‑nominal)\nBetter: Our project manager is the contact point for new task orders. (adjective & noun)\nBest: Contact our project manager for new task orders. (verb)\nCompleting the bottling plant after December 4, 20XX, \nwould be in violation of the contract. (nominal)\nBetter: Completing the bottling plant after December 4, 20XX, would violate the contract. \n(verb)\nThe Shipley Seven-Phase Process has wide \napplicability for a variety of organizations. (nominal)\nBetter: The Shipley Seven-Phase Process applies to a variety of organizations. (verb)\nTeam HAWK fully supports the separate use of \nappropriate performance metrics for assessing \nperformance of Third-Level Maintenance tasks.\nBetter: Team HAWK fully supports using performance metrics to assess Third-Level \nMaintenance tasks. (eliminating the prepositions)\nBest examples: (State item warranting emphasis first, either using metrics or assessing \nperformance).\nTeam HAWK supports using metrics to assess Third-Level Maintenance task performance.\nTeam HAWK will assess Third-Level Maintenance task performance using metrics.\nFigure 3. Simplify Sentence Construction. Convert nominals to verbs or adjectives. Convert prepositional phrases to adjectives or adverbs. \nNominals are words or groups of words that function as nouns. Shifting to a verb, adverb, or adjective construction is more emphatic and easier \nto comprehend.\n6\t\nUSE PRECISE, POWERFUL, DESCRIPTIVE VERBS.\nSearch your proposals for verbs like allow, allow for, permit, \nprovide, provide for, perform, and ensure. \nDo you literally mean to give the customer or yourself \npermission to do something? Reword the phrase using the \nmore powerful and precise word that is often hiding in  \nthe sentence.\nFigure 4 demonstrates improved constructions.\nPOOR\nBETTER\nConsideration is being given for . . .\nWe are considering. . . ; We considered . . . ,or Consider . . .\nWe will provide opportunities for training.\nWe will train . . .; We train . . . ,or Training is offered . . .\nBid/no-bid milestone reviews provide for improved decision-making.\nBid/no-bid reviews improve bid decisions.\nOur project manager performs task reviews.\nOur project manager reviews tasks.\nOur project management process, which is ISO-certified, allows for im-\nproved management decisions.\nOur ISO-certified project management process improves man-\nagement decisions.\nThe e-Entry system allows for the accurate entry of new orders by cus-\ntomer service representatives. \nCustomer representatives can accurately enter new orders \nusing the e-Entry system. \nFigure 4. Use Powerful, Accurate Verbs. Replace imprecise verbs like allow, provide, permit, perform, and ensure with a stronger, more \naccurate verb. \n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n44\n©Shipley Associates\nThe best proposals describe what the customer wants to hear, \nspeaking directly to their issues, fears, hopes, and dreams. \nPeople forget what you say but remember how you made \nthem feel. Are you perceived as the safe choice, or the trusted \nteam of colleagues working with reliable, familiar, proven \nproducts?\nSome of the most effective verbs prompt powerful, emotional, \nvisual images that are more effective than a proposal graphic. \nImagine . . . might be the most powerful verb in the English \nlanguage, unless used inappropriately. Dr. Martin Luther King’s \nI have a dream . . . speech phrasing connected with millions \nof individual’s dreams without the need to precisely describe \nthose dreams. \nWhile not grammatically correct, consider using the future \ntense (will train) the first time you mention an event, then shift \nto the present tense (train).\nGrammatically incorrect but stronger\nTo reduce transition risk, we will train all employees. Employees are \ntrained to use the new workstations, get Help Desk assistance, and \nreport network outages.\nGrammatically correct but weaker\nTo reduce transition risk, we will train all employees. Employees will \nbe trained to use the new workstations, get Help Desk assistance, and \nreport network outages.\nThe grammatically correct version is weaker and longer.\n7\t\nUSE GRABBERS, TRANSITIONS, AND CLINCHERS EFFECTIVELY AND  \nAPPROPRIATELY IN YOUR PROPOSALS AND PRESENTATIONS.\nGrabbers are designed to capture a customer’s attention \nwithout offending. Grabbers include headings, slogans, \nsalutations, opening challenges, and theme statements. \nWritten and spoken language has a rhythm and texture. A \nstring of words that have the same first letter, ending letters, \nsound, or cadence is more memorable. Alliteration and rhyme \nmake a phrase memorable, within reason.\nHowever, rare but deliberate violation of language rules is \nalso memorable. Often effective proposal grabbers are subtle \nvariations of popular advertising catch phrases. \nTransitions signal a change of topic, link or relate topics, \nand regain the customer’s attention. Traditional documents \nplace transitions at the end of a topic or section, implicitly \nassuming the document is read in order. Because proposals \nare often scanned, transitions in proposals are more effective \nwhen placed at the beginning of a section to recapture the \nevaluator’s attention.\nClinchers are closing statements in sales documents that \nprompt the customer to take the action you have requested. \nEffective clinchers prompt the customer to act.\nExamples of grabbers, transitions, and clinchers are listed in \nfigure 5.\n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n45\n©Shipley Associates\nGRABBERS\nTRANSITIONS\nCLINCHERS\nH E A D I N G S  A N D  S L O G A N S\nCan you afford to . . .\nProven . . .\nCompare the difference . . .\nSwitch to . . .\nEasy to use.\nThe right choice.\nS A L U TAT I O N S  (OTHER THAN “DEAR . . . ”)\nWelcome to . . .\nA special invitation . . .\nPlease attend . . .\nJoin us . . .\nProposal to . . .\nQ U E S T I O N S\nAre your managers . . .\nAre you spending . . .\nCan you afford to . . .\nCan you . . .\nS TAT E M E N TS\nIn the 10 seconds it took you to read . . . \nMost sales managers . . .\nC H A L L E N G E S\nCapture more ____ by . . .\nEnjoy the . . .\nSee how . . .\nAfter careful study, . . .\nAs you requested, . . .\nAs you witnessed at . . .\nAt less than the cost of . . .\nBest of all . . .\nBut if you are more concerned with . . .\nConsidering your recent service record, . . . \nFortunately, . . .\nIf your managers are experiencing . . .\nIn summary, . . . \nMore importantly, . . .\nSimply stated, . . .\nSo far, so good.\nSo what’s the typical result?\nTo illustrate our approach, . . .\nClick on ____ to . . .\nFor the fastest response, . . . \nGo to our website to . . .\nIf you agree that _____, then . . .\nIf you can’t wait, call . . . \nI’ll call you at 2:00 p.m. Tuesday to . . .\nSee for yourself by . . .\nSee what others are saying . . .\nTo ensure you get the first selection . . .\nWaiting could push you into the next . . .\nWith current costs of ____ per day, can \nyou afford to wait?\nFigure 5. Use Grabbers, Transitions, and Clinchers Carefully. Most of these examples are found in advertising copy. Avoid empty claims. Be \nspecific. Every word counts in these key persuasive phrases. Blanks (____) or ellipses (. . . ) indicate where you would insert appropriate words or \nphrases for your products and services.\n8\t\nAVOID WORDS AND PHRASES THAT INCREASE CONTRACT RISK.\nChoosing to avoid certain words can be as important as \nchoosing correct words. Avoid the following categories of \nwords and phrases:\n•\t Unsupportable claims\n•\t Superlatives\n•\t Overly inclusive\n•\t Unnecessarily negative\n•\t Firm guarantees not required in the terms and conditions\nUnsupportable claims are not backed by evidence in \nthe following text or graphics. Evaluators not only doubt \nunsupported claims, but they subsequently question the \naccuracy of the seller’s other oral and written statements. \nFor example, saying that you offer quality laboratory testing \nservices does not discriminate your offer. No one says that they \noffer poor quality service in their proposal. \nLack of specificity implies that you have no data to support \nyour claim. Many unsupported claims are jargon, such as \n“world class,” “leading edge,” and “best-in-class.”\nSuperlatives often end in est, such as greatest, best, fastest, \nlowest cost, and safest. Superlatives are both hard to support \nand risky. \nAdvise writers and presenters to convert est-phrases to er-\nphrases. Use the er-phrase to explain, support, or justify why. \nPoor est-phrases\nOur PC hard drive is the fastest in the world.\nOur order tracking software is the easiest to operate.\nBetter er-phrases\nOur PC hard drive is faster than prior versions because it has a larger \nbuffer.\nThe graphical user interface makes our order tracking software easier \nto operate.\n See JARGON.\n\nChoosing Correct Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n46\n©Shipley Associates\nOverly inclusive phrasing may guarantee services and abilities \nthat you do not actually deliver. \nPoor examples\nAll service calls are answered within 1 minute.\nEvery project manager is APMP certified.\nWe follow customary procedures when relocating staff.\nBetter examples\nService calls are answered within 1 minute.\nOur project managers are APMP certified.\nStaff relocation procedures are defined in our HR Policies & Proce-\ndures Manual.\nUnnecessarily negative words and phrases are off-putting. \nState the positive side or implication. “Win rate” and “accuracy \nrate” are better than “loss rate” and “error rate.”\nPoor example\nCustomer claims are never rejected without valid justification.\nBetter example\nCustomers are given an EOB (Explanation of Benefits) stating how the \nclaim was handled, who received reimbursement, and what portion \nof the claim, if any, was not covered by the plan.\nAvoid firm guarantees that are not required in the terms \nand conditions of your customer’s contract. As performance-\nbased acquisitions increase, firm guarantees are increasingly \nrequired. Most organizations’ contracts or legal departments \nhave established guidelines for their organizations.\nFigure 6 lists words and phrases that should be avoided or \nused cautiously.\nall\nall encompassing\nanywhere\nas may be required\nassure\nbest-of-breed\nconstantly\ncustomary\neach and every\nensure\nevery\neverywhere\nfastest\nfully\ngreatest\nguarantee\ninsure\nlowest\nmost\nnever\nno\nreasonable and \ncustomary\nsafest\ntotal\nworldwide\nW O R D S  A N D  \nP H R A S E S  T O  A V O I D\nFigure 6. Words and Phrases to Avoid or Use with Caution. Start with this list and add your own words and phrases. Search your proposal for \nthese words and consider whether changes are needed.\n\nCliches\nShipley Proposal Guide\n47\n©Shipley Associates\nCLICHES\nCliches are a form of shorthand and difficult to avoid entirely. \nCliches are tempting when the writer is struggling to express \nan idea. However, cliches reduce the persuasiveness of sales \ndocuments. If the cliche is noticeable, reword the phrase.\nThe word cliché comes from French. While the accent mark \ncan be used, the word has been Anglicized and the accent is \ncommonly omitted.\nMetaphors use a word or phrase to suggest likeness or \nsimilarity. These may become cliches over time if overused.\nMany metaphors make inappropriate comparisons:\nOur engineers have a long row to hoe to complete the data  \nwarehouse design by July 1.\nMixed metaphors can be laughable:\nOur program manager is a tower of strength, who will forge ahead \nwith this program. (Towers do not move.)\nOther cliches are alliterations, such as labor of love and feel \nfree to.\nCliche examples often overlap with redundant words, such \nas final analysis, and wordy phrases, such as thanking you in \nadvance and confirming our conversation.\nCliches are worn-out phrases or words that are no longer effective. Avoid cliches. Regular use usually indicates lack of thought \nand effort.\nCLICHES\nEliminate noticeable cliches from your proposals.\n1\n1\t\nELIMINATE NOTICEABLE CLICHES FROM YOUR PROPOSALS.\nCliches are worn-out words or phrases that have lost meaning \nor effectiveness. Sales and sales support professionals \nuse cliches to open or close sales documents out of habit, \nconvenience, or to avoid serious thought:\nConfirming our conversation . . .\nEnclosed please find . . .\nWe are pleased to present . . .\nRemember two key principles of organization to reduce \nopening cliches:\n1.\t Begin with the most important point to the reader.\n2.\t Avoid unnecessary or long setups.\nMany proposals open with seller-focused cliches.\nGlobal Corporation is pleased to have the opportunity to present this \nproposal for Super Widgets.\nThank you for allowing us to submit our proposal for Super Widgets.\nIs your gratitude the most important \nconcern of the customer? \nCliched openings evoke images of \nbegging.\nProfessional sellers offering \nvaluable products and services in a complex sale should \ninteract as professionals. Begging debases the professional \nimage you are seeking to foster.\nNoticeable cliches distract \nthe customer from your \nmessage. Others delay \nthe reader from getting to \nthe message, wasting the \nreader’s time.\n\nCliches\nShipley Proposal Guide\n48\n©Shipley Associates\nClosing with cliches wastes the opportunity to close with \npower. Readers remember the first thing they read, the last \nthing they read, and repeated points. \nCut thoughtless, cliched closes.\nPlease don’t hesitate to call.\nInstead of using cliches, prompt action. Suggest the next step.\nTo prompt those who read your executive summary to read \nyour proposal, close with an introduction or preview to your \nproposal.\nOur proposal mirrors the issues discussed in our meetings. Should \nyour requirements change, we welcome the opportunity to discuss \nfurther enhancements.\nMany sales documents seek extensions or additions to existing \ncontracts. If the next realistically achievable step is action, \nsuggest the action.\nI will call you June 6 at 2:00 p.m. to answer any questions and to \nschedule a follow-up meeting. Please call me at 800-777-0077 for \nadditional information.\nWhile possibly seeming aggressive, this proactive close is more \nrealistic. Most sales professionals know that customers invited \nto call seldom do.\nWriters often make return calls difficult by omitting a phone \nnumber and the name of the contact. Make sure the action \nsuggested is possible:\nPlease call Kevin Newman, our proposed Acme Project Manager, at \n800-777-0077 for additional information.\nHere are a few poor sales and proposal cliches:\nGlobal Corporation is grateful for the opportunity to be a participant \nin this switching proposal.\nWe take much pleasure in enclosing our proposal for . . . \nThe XYZ Team is a force in being.\nAdditional cliches are listed below in figure 1.\nCLICHES\nA can of worms\nA-1\nacid test\na slam dunk\nas a matter of fact\nat the end of the day\nat this point in time\nattached hereto\navoid it like the plague\nawaiting further orders\nBack to the drawing board\nbang for the buck\nbanner week\nbenefit of the doubt\nbeside the point\nbest-of-breed\nbetter late than never\nbite the bullet\nblock out\nbuilt-in safeguards\nCircumstances beyond our control\ncity fathers\nclean slate\ncome full circle\nconfirming our conversation\nconsidered opinion\nconspicuous by its absence\ncream of the crop\ncrying need\ncustomer intimacy\ncut to the chase\nDark horse\ndead meat\ndiscreet silence\ndog-and-pony show\ndrastic action\ndriving down costs\nEach and every\neasier said than done\nexisting conditions\nFeel free to\nfew and far between\nfinal analysis\nfood for thought\nforegone conclusion\nGet everyone on the same page\ngive the green light to\ngoes without saying\ngolden boy\ngood team player\ngrave concern\ngrind to a halt\nHad me stumped\nhammer out a deal\nhard and fast\nhat in hand\nhave a field day\nheard it through the grapevine\nhue and cry\nhorns of a dilemma\nhot pursuit\nIll-fated\nin close proximity\nin no uncertain terms\nin the loop\nin the pipeline\nin this day and age\ninnocent bystander\niron out the problem\ninside track\ninvolve all our/your stakeholders\nKeep options open\nLast analysis\nlast but not least\nlast-ditch effort\nleaves much to be desired\nlevel playing field\nline of least resistance\nMake sure we’re pulling in the \nsame direction\nmake the case for\nman of the hour\nmarked contrast\nmoment of truth\nmoot point\nmore or less\nmoving the goalposts\nNarrow escape\nneedless to say\nneeds no introduction\nOne and the same\nongoing dialog\nopen and shut\nout of the loop\nParadigm shift\npoint-blank range\npoint in time\npoint with pride\npushing the envelope\nQuick and dirty\nRaising the bar\nreading from the same page\nreinventing the wheel\nresearch-proven and field-tested\nrunning against the wind/tide\nrun of the mill\nSacred cow\nsaid and done\nseamless infrastructure\nseamless transition\nsecond to none\nseeing the big picture\nselect few\nserious money\nseat of the pants\nsmoke and mirrors\nspending a bundle\nsubstantive and sustained change\nTake it off-line\nthanking you in advance\nthe big picture\nthinking outside the box\nthose present\ntie-breaker\ntoo numerous to mention\ntrack record\nturnkey operation\nUnprecedented opportunity\nunprecedented situation\nWear and tear\nwhere the rubber meets the road\nwinning and inclusive culture\nwithout further ado\t\n Figure 1.

Keep colors the same hue if elements are of \nequal importance. Use tints to show greater amounts of the \nsame element.\nFull color printing on expensive stock for an entire proposal is \nexcessive for some customers but acceptable or expected with \nothers. Consider each customer and be consistent.\nColor adds impact to documents and presentations. Depending on the industry, nearly all presentations and proposals use color. \nCOLOR\nUse color where it adds the most value.\nEstablish color standards as part of your \nnormal style sheet.\nAdjust your color scheme to the medium.\n1\n2\n3\nFollow the recommendations of  \ngraphics professionals.\nConsider the emotions and associations evoked \nby color and possible sight limitations.\nBalance the benefits of color with its  \nincreased production time and cost.\n4\n5\n6\nSee GRAPHICS and \nPHOTOGRAPHS.\n\nColor\nShipley Proposal Guide\n50\n©Shipley Associates\nIf the customer includes specific \nguidelines in the RFP for formatting the \nproposal cover, follow the RFP. However, \nclever proposal covers, packaging, and \npresentation can have a powerful impact in the right situation, \nas in these examples: \nA bidder to develop a software package for a large pizza chain \nsubmitted a proposal in the chain’s box, creating a strong, positive \nimpression.\nAn executive summary submitted to a national rental car chain was \nprepared to emulate the color rental folders at the customer’s airport \ncounters.\nA cover graphic, repeated on the first page of the executive summary, \nshowed color pictures of the desired products superimposed on a \ndeclining cost curve. The proposal was to reduce the cost of a critical \nraw material used to manufacture the desired products.\nUse color in the executive summary, the most important pages \nin your proposal. \nAn executive summary to a frozen food trucking company for infor-\nmation technology (IT) outsourcing used small color photos of the \ncustomer’s convenience stores. The executive summary demonstrated \nunderstanding of the customer’s business and the added value of IT \nsupport in helping the trucking company meet client commitments \nand maintain product quality.\nColor photos or graphics showing the benefits of the product \nor service are usually more effective than photos of the \nproduct or delivery of the services being quoted.\nUse color in the rest of your proposal where it adds value. \nWhile color logos are OK, fairly standard, and recommended, \nthey will not discriminate you from most competitors.\nUse color graphics to support your claims of experience and \noffer proof of performance. Photos showing you performing \nsimilar work inspire confidence.\nSee RELEVANT \nEXPERIENCE/PAST \nPERFORMANCE.\nColor is \na visual \nemphasis \ndevice.\n“ \n”\n2\t\nESTABLISH COLOR STANDARDS AS PART OF YOUR NORMAL STYLE SHEET.\nSet color standards early to save time. \nMaintaining color standards is easier on larger \nproposals with professional graphics support.\nIf many different individuals produce their own proposals, \nestablish one or two style sheets in the software of choice with \ncolors defined. Two standards, one conservative and one more \ncolorful, permit a better match with the customer’s  \nbusiness style.\nSee PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT \nDESIGN.\n1\t\nUSE COLOR WHERE IT ADDS THE MOST VALUE.\nColor is a visual emphasis device. Use color to reinforce your \nstrategy, connecting client benefits to key discriminators.\nNearly all proposals use color on the covers. Try to develop a \ncolor graphic that conveys the essence of the sale.\nWhen numerous proposals are submitted to a customer with \na largely undefined evaluation process, the engaging color \nproposal cover might cause it to be read.\n\nColor\nShipley Proposal Guide\n51\n©Shipley Associates\nThe high contrast of black print on white paper makes text \neasy to read. Most proposals are printed on white or near-\nwhite paper using dark or colored ink. \nCareless use of color sometimes makes a proposal hard to \nread. Black or dark print on color or shaded backgrounds with \nlittle contrast makes reading difficult. \nWhite or reverse print on dark background is also hard to read \nwith extensive text, a common practice in marketing materials.\nPresentations must be color adjusted to the medium. \nLaptop screens and TV monitors are more visible with dark \nbackgrounds and light print. Because light print tends \nto be swallowed by dark \nbackgrounds, select a bolder \nor wider version of your font to \nimprove readability.\nDirect computer projection \nsystems permit use in rooms \nwith full lighting. Use light backgrounds \nand dark text with a quality projector.\n3\t\nADJUST YOUR COLOR SCHEME TO THE MEDIUM. \nSee PRESENTATIONS \nTO CUSTOMERS, \nCapture Guide.\n4\t\nFOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GRAPHICS PROFESSIONALS.\nWhile color selection and document design are usually \nimproved when left to graphics professionals, many proposals \nand sales documents are created by individuals or small teams \nwithout assistance. A few principles will help you use color \nmore effectively.\nBegin with the style standards or guidelines of your \norganization. Follow them or refer to guidelines in published \nstyle guides, design books, or the desktop publishing \ndocumentation manuals that came with your software. \nAlternatively, imitate the style of similar documents that \nappeal to you and the customer.\nA basic color wheel shows colors in different hues. A shade is a \ndarkened hue, created on paper by adding black. Conversely, \na tint is created on paper by adding white. The color wheel \nin figure 1 shows the relationship between hues, tints, and \nshades.\nIf the customer dictates color and styles, follow the customer’s \ninstructions.\nHUE\nTINT\nSHADE\nFigure 1. The Color Wheel. Complementary colors are opposite on \nthe color wheel. Their high contrast is used to grab attention and \nhighlight differences. Harmonious colors are adjacent on the color \nwheel. Harmonious colors, shades, or tints are used to show subtle \nvariations and to show associations, harmony, or consistency be-\ntween elements.\nOn-screen colors often  \nproject differently. Either \ncarry your own tested pro-\njector and laptop or try to \ntest the borrowed projector \nbefore making your  \npresentation.\n5\t\nCONSIDER THE EMOTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS EVOKED BY COLOR AND  \nPOSSIBLE SIGHT LIMITATIONS.\nConsider your corporate image, the audience, and the \nobjective of your presentation or document. Colors may cause \nthe emotional responses summarized in figure 2. \nColors evoke different emotions in different cultures, \nimpacting international proposals. \nFor example, various cultures have \nentirely different emotions and \nreferences attached to colors. In many Eastern societies, red \nand black are associated with power and good. White is often \nthe color of mourning and death. In the United States, white \nis associated with purity and innocence. In Islamic societies, \ncertain shades of green have religious significance. \nSee INTERNATIONAL \nPROPOSALS.\n\nColor\nShipley Proposal Guide\n52\n©Shipley Associates\nCertain color combinations may evoke unintended \nassociations with holidays, such as orange/black (Halloween), \nand red/purple (Valentine’s Day). Research color use when \npreparing proposals and documents targeting international \ncustomers.\nConsider that 10 percent of the male and 5 percent of the \nfemale population are red/green color blind. Being color blind \ndoes not mean a person sees in black and white or blue mono-\nchrome but might confuse shades of red, green, and brown, or \nblue and purple. Whether colors are confused depends on the \nintensity of the hue and the brightness of the light conditions. \nConsider these guidelines on color design:\n•\t Avoid similar saturations of red, green, brown, gray, or \npurple next to or on top of each other; do not use these \ncolors together in a gradient blend.\n•\t Create a strong, bright contrast between foreground and \nbackground colors for both page text and images. Even \nseverely color-blind readers can differentiate similar \ncolors when contrasted between light and dark.\n•\t Add textures, patterns, or shading to set off special areas. \nDo not use colors alone in graphics such as bar charts, \nmaps, and navigation bars. \n•\t Use contrasting colors and contrasting saturations to \ndifferentiate between important items when you must \nuse color alone.\nUse two cool colors for text and graphics on a slide or page. \nCool colors are calm and relaxing for most people. Cool colors \ninclude:\nUse hot colors sparingly: one or two key words, bullets, arrow \npoints, or special effects. Hot colors are stimulating; never use \nthem for text. Hot colors include:\nBLUE\nPURPLE\nGREEN\nBROWN\nCYAN\nBLACK\nMAGENTA\nORANGE\nRED\nCOLOR\nEMOTIONAL ASSOCIATION\nBEST USE\nBlue\nPeaceful, soothing, cool; Authority, power (sometimes)\nBackgrounds (90 percent of all business presentations)  \nDark shades often used for printed headings\nWhite\nNeutral, purity, wisdom\nFont color choice for dark background\nYellow\nWarm, cheerful\nBullets, subheads on dark background\nRed\nLosses, danger, action; Excitement, energy\nBullets and highlights, seldom as a background\nGreen\nMoney, growth, assertive, warmth, comfort (sometimes)\nHighlights, occasionally as a background\nFigure 2. Making the Best Use of Color. In Western cultures, colors tend to have the emotional associations indicated. Remember that persua-\nsion is 50 percent emotion and 50 percent logic. The specific emotional association will vary with the type of audience, individual, and culture. \n6\t\nBALANCE THE BENEFITS OF COLOR WITH ITS INCREASED PRODUCTION TIME \nAND COST.\nPreparing graphics and printing in color may double the cost.\nColor graphics also increase file sizes. Many \norganizations send final color printing to an \noutside vendor, which impacts production time.\nConsider color-matching problems. Different monitors, \nprinters, and projection systems use different color systems. \nOften the graphic that looks great on screen will print or \nproject with different colors depending on the printer, the \nprojector, and the software.\nSee PRODUCTION.\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n53\n©Shipley Associates\nCOLOR TEAM REVIEWS\nAs a bid response or proposal evolves, regular (often daily) \nstatus reviews are important to monitor the progress and \nquality of the response. Formal color team reviews at key \nmilestones will enhance the pursuit quality and refine your \ncustomer focus. Conduct color team reviews to gain unbiased \nassessments of progress and constructive recommendations \nfor improvement.\nDifferentiate color team reviews from pursuit decision gates \nand frequent status reviews. While decision gates determine \nwhether to advance an opportunity to the next business \ndevelopment phase or to end pursuit, color teams strengthen \ncapture planning and proposal development efforts between \ndecision gates. Decision gates reflect executives’ strategies, \ndirections, goals, and priorities. In contrast, color teams help \nyou move the proposal or pursuit forward, increasing your \nprobability of winning.\nChoose color team reviewers with \nbalanced customer, seller, management, \ntechnical, and cost perspectives. Align \ntheir backgrounds to the review. Select \nreviewers capable of offering constructive \nrecommendations, independent of their \nseniority. Train reviewers if necessary. \nDo not assume they are qualified or \nknowledgeable based on their titles \nor seniority. \nMake color team reviews constructive \nby defining and following a set \nprocess. Institutionalize key reviews \nfor all opportunities. Be agile in your \nregular and frequent status reviews.\nColor team reviews are key milestones where pursuit contributors and managers collaborate to improve the probability of winning \n(Pwin) a pursuit. Done correctly, reviews are cost effective ways to improve the overall success of your capture planning and proposal \ndevelopment efforts. Regular status meetings should always be conducted between formal color team reviews to monitor progress of \nthe proposal or pursuit.\nCOLOR TEAM REVIEWS\nDefine your organization’s color team \nreview points.\nFollow a consistent yet flexible approach \nfor each color team review.\nConduct a Pink Team review to verify compliance \nand alignment with your win strategy.\n1\n2\n3\nConduct a Green Team review to validate cost \ninformation and approve pricing.\nConduct a Gold Team review to confirm your proposal \nincorporates changes from Red and Green Teams and is \nready for submittal.\nConduct a White Hat review to record lessons learned \nand recommend improvements.\n5\n6\n7\nSee DECISION GATE \nREVIEWS,  \nCapture Guide.\nColor team reviews, color \nteams, and color reviews \nall refer to the same type of \nevent.\nColor team members, color \nreviewers, and review teams \nall refer to people performing \nthe color team review.\nColor team can refer to the \nreview itself or the group con-\nducting it.

While \nsome organizations succeed in spite of or without defined \nprocesses, their probability of winning could be increased by \nfollowing best practices for key milestone reviews, including \nregular status checks. \nBe flexible and schedule color \nteam reviews suitable to the \ncomplexity and timeline of the \npursuit.

Each Review Has a Purpose. Color teams’ purposes are tied to the progress of the pursuit. Blue Team and Black Hat help develop \nstrategy during pre-proposal phases of the pursuit. Pink, Red, Green, and Gold Teams occur in rapid sequence during proposal development \nand focus on creating a compliant, responsive, competitive proposal response. White Hat reviews take place after proposals are submitted (win \nor lose) and help improve future efforts. Regular status reviews are conducted between the formal reviews.\nSee PROCESS.\nExplanations for color designa-\ntions vary. Red Team may get its \nname from mark-ups in red ink \non paper proposal copies. Some \nsay Green Team refers to the col-\nor of money (though not in every \ncountry). If you hear a color \nassociated with a team review, \nclarify what is to be reviewed.\nAs a minimum, systematically require reviews focused  \non two items:\n•\t Proposal content and messages before drafting text (Pink \nTeam).\n•\t Proposal near-final content compared against the \ncustomer’s needs and evaluation approach (Red Team).\nSome organizations use functional names instead of color \nidentifiers to avoid confusion: win strategy review instead of \nBlue Team or proposal design review rather than Pink Team. \nHowever, descriptive titles might not mean the same thing in \ndifferent organizations.\nYour goal for the review is more important than the name. \nMultiple reviews may be required based on certain situations:\n•\t The customer changes requirements or deadlines.\n•\t Your internal resources, solution, or teaming partners \nhave changed.\n•\t New competitive or customer information is available. \nGood reviews lead to better pursuit decisions, including bid/\nno-bid decisions.\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n55\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nFOLLOW A CONSISTENT YET FLEXIBLE APPROACH FOR EACH  \nCOLOR TEAM REVIEW.\nEach color team review serves a different purpose, prompting \na somewhat different form. Flexibility is key. Some reviews \nemphasize, discussion, improvement, or approval of sales/\ncapture or proposal team work. Others are hands-on working \nsessions that contribute directly to successful pursuit of the \nopportunity. Regardless of their nature, follow the general \napproach outlined in figure 2 \nand include inputs gained during \nregular status review sessions \nwith contributors.\n•\t Plan and schedule in \ndetail.\n•\t Adjust dates to accom-\nmodate availability of \nkey reviewers.\n•\t Stick to published \nschedule.\n•\t Identify members with \nrequisite skills and au-\nthority for review.\n•\t Limit involvement of \ncapture or proposal team \nmembers to promote \nindependence and avoid \ndefensiveness.\n•\t Train reviewers on \npurpose of review, tools \nto be used, and expected \noutcomes.\n•\t Develop in-briefing with \nassignments, protocols, \ntiming, documents to \nreview, resources, and \nopportunity background.\n•\t Present in-briefing.\n•\t Review individually, read-\ning assigned documents, \ncritiquing strengths \nand weaknesses, and \nrecording findings and \nrecommendations.\n•\t Discuss as a group, cate-\ngorizing and summariz-\ning findings, consolidat-\ning recommendations, \nand agreeing on action \nitems.\n•\t Report results via review \nsummary or debriefing \nfor capture and proposal \nteam members.\n•\t Deliver debriefing to \ncontributors.\n•\t Collect, organize, and \ndistribute products of \nreview, including com-\nment sheets, marked-up \ndocuments, scorecards, \nreports, and summaries.\n•\t Support capture and pro-\nposal teams in respond-\ning to recommendations.\n•\t Archive review materials \nfor later reference.\n•\t Execute and verify \nagreed action items.\nFigure 2. Approach for Color Team Reviews. Take a consistent approach to all reviews. No matter the \ncolor of the review, follow the same approach: prepare, conduct, and respond. At each step, follow the \nguidelines listed above.\nEstablish consistent \nstandards for color team \nreviews. Insist that reviewers \ntell you how to improve, not \nwhat is wrong.\nMake your reviews:\nComprehensive. Review all \nelements of any reviewed \ndocument using defined cri-\nteria. Consider all the facts, \nnot just favorable ones.\nPositive. Maintain a col-\nlaborative tone aimed at \nimproving your chances, not \ndemoralizing contributors.\nConstructive. Require \nreviewers to recommend im-\nprovements and eliminate \nvague, negative comments.\nFor an explanation of the Blue \nTeam and Black Hat reviews \nthat occur during capture \nplanning, see the Shipley \nCapture Guide. This section \nfocuses on the reviews typical \nof proposal planning and \ndevelopment. \n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n56\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nCONDUCT A PINK TEAM REVIEW TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE AND  \nALIGNMENT WITH YOUR WIN STRATEGY.\nThe Pink Team reviews proposal content plans, including \nstoryboards, mockups, or outlines before text is drafted. Many \nproposal practitioners consider Pink Team the most important \nreview. More proposals fail because of poorly executed or \nnonexistent Pink Team reviews than any other cause.\nTeam members review inputs listed in figure 3 to verify \ncompliance and responsiveness to customer hot button \nissues. They verify how well the proposal team is executing \nthe approved win strategy and recommend necessary \nchanges. This powerful influence over how the proposal will \nbe completed dictates knowledgeable and empowered Pink \nTeam members.\nFigure 3. Pink Team Inputs and Outputs. The Pink Team reviews the entire planned proposal—in the form of content plans—against the  \ncustomer’s proposal instructions and evaluation factors. This team verifies total compliance with requirements of the solicitation,  \nresponsiveness to unstated customer issues, and satisfactory expression of the approved sales/capture and proposal strategies. The Pink  \nTeam also reviews the effectiveness of theme statements, visuals, and action captions.\nThe Pink Team is usually scheduled approximately 20–25 \npercent of the way between the receipt of a solicitation \nand submission. Consider two Pink Teams, especially if \nthe customer issues a good draft solicitation. The first \nreviews early content planning. The second comes after the \nfinal solicitation and reviews updates and changes in the \ncustomer’s acquisition plans. You cannot verify compliance \nuntil the customer’s final request is released.\nThe Pink Team should consolidate its findings and either brief \nthe proposal team or furnish documented recommendations \nto the proposal manager for action. Present recommendations \nconstructively to authors as suggestions for improvements \nrather than negative criticism of their work. Emphasize that \nearly changes eliminate or reduce inconvenient, frantic, last-\nminute rewrites.\n4\t\nCONDUCT A RED TEAM REVIEW TO PREDICT HOW YOUR PROPOSAL WILL BE \nSCORED. THEN, MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO IT.\nLeveraging inputs from regular status sessions with \ncontributors, the Red Team review predicts how well your \nnear-final proposal would be scored by the customer. It \nrecommends improvements to customer focus, completeness, \nand clear communication of your solution and win strategy.\nAvoid exploring new solutions, new themes, or major changes \nin direction. Strategy changes should have been directed by \nthe Pink Team. Best practice is to arrange about one-third \noverlap between Pink and Red Team members to avoid \nconflicting suggestions.\nRed Team members should be independent of the proposal \nteam and offer different perspectives. Effective teams include \nexperts on the customer; the customer’s industry; competitors; \nyour organization, technology, and solution; and on preparing \nand presenting winning proposals. To prevent Red Teams from \ndegenerating into editing sessions, follow guidance in figure 4.\nDocumented Comments and \nRecommendations\nOutputs\nPink\nTeam \nReview\nCapture and Proposal Strategies\nProposal Instructions\nInputs\nEvaluation Factors\nProposal Outline\nConfirmation or Redirection \non Strategy\nMaster Compliance Checklist\nCompleted Content Plans \n(Storyboards and Mockups)\nVerified Compliance Checklist\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n57\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 4. Red Team Inputs and Outputs. The Red Team reviews the near-final proposal. Just as the customer’s evaluation team will review \nyour entire proposal, the Red Team must review every word, number, and visual. Thorough in-briefings are essential. Arm the Red Team with \nthe customer’s evaluation factors, detailed assignments, instructions, tools, methods for recording review comments and results, and the \nmaster compliance checklist. \nSchedule Red Team about two-thirds to three-fourths of the \nway through Proposal Development, early enough that when \nchanges are made to one part of the proposal, coordinating \nadjustments can be made to others. \nInclude the price volume in your Red Team review. You may \nnot have final numbers, but verify that required content will \nhave a place when available.\nAsk reviewers to consolidate findings to minimize conflicting \nrecommendations. Complicated reviews of larger proposals \nneed to be controlled using a standard set of feedback tools. \nTrain reviewers to use these tools.\nUse vertical and horizontal reviews of customer-bound \ndocuments. Vertical reviews focus on a single topic or section. \nHorizontal reviews focus on the consistency, continuity, and \nquality of a single element across the entire proposal.\n5\t\nCONDUCT A GREEN TEAM REVIEW TO VALIDATE COST INFORMATION AND  \nAPPROVE PRICING.\nThe Green Team reviews near-final pricing and various cost \nelements of the proposal. It compares your pricing against \ndocumentation of your technical, management, and other \nnon-price solution elements to confirm everything is included \nin the estimate, helps prevent discrepancies, and maintains \nalignment with your price to win. This team may also examine \nfinancial risk, cash flow projections, and return on investment.\nMajor objectives of the Green Team review are advance \nknowledge and approval of proposed pricing by relevant \nexecutives before the final Proposal Submittal Decision. Hasty, \nlast-minute price cuts lead to frequent proposal errors. Exact \nestimating and approval procedures within your organization \nwill dictate when it is scheduled.\nSome organizations combine Green Team with Red Team, but \nin many cases, full pricing and cost information takes longer to \ndevelop than the rest of the proposal, delaying review of the \nfinal price. In those cases, the Red Team can still review the \nprice proposal narrative and graphics, subject to numerical \nupdates. Other organizations prefer holding the Green Team \nfirst, allowing the Red Team to verify that changes caused \nby price modificatios have been correctly folded into the \nproposal.\nBecause price influences competitiveness, Green Teams \nconsider information from customer, sales/capture team, and \nproposal team sources, as shown in figure 5. This information \nis often in spreadsheets, tables, basis of estimates (BOEs), and \nraw calculations. Green Team members are seldom disposed \ntoward detailed price volume review, focusing on the deal \nrather than the documents.\nQuantitative Scoring Prediction\nOutputs\nQualitative Assessment\nDocumentation of Findings\nRed\nTeam \nReview\nFinal Proposal Draft\nRed Team Kickoff Briefing\nInputs\nEvaluation Factors\nRed Team Assignments\nRed Team Instructions\nReview Forms\nMaster Compliance Checklist\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n58\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 5. Green Team Inputs and Outputs. Green Teams use inputs from many sources. Outputs are fewer, including either approval or re-\nquired changes to pricing and associated portions of the proposal.\nIf multiple Green Teams are held, the first generally occurs \nduring capture planning and reviews your price to win—that \ntargeted combination of capability and price thought to appeal \nto the customer’s values. The second is the actual pricing \nreview near the Red Team.\n6\t\nCONDUCT A GOLD TEAM REVIEW TO CONFIRM YOUR PROPOSAL INCORPORATES  \nCHANGES FROM RED AND GREEN TEAMS AND IS READY FOR SUBMITTAL.\nThe Gold Team reviews the final version of the proposal and \nconfirms improvements recommended by Red and Green \nTeams have been incorporated. This team also verifies \nproposal document quality and conformance to organizational \nstandards, as shown in figure 6 below.\nThe Gold Team is not the time to modify your price, change \nyour solution, or improve grammar. The Gold Team looks \nfor errors or omissions in the submission. In summary, Gold \nTeam determines if the bid or proposal document is ready and \napproved for submission.\nFigure 6. Gold Team Inputs and Outputs. The Gold Team reviews the fully completed proposal, including all volumes, letters, electronic files, \nand other material requested by the customer.

More \nthan one lessons learned review may be conducted. This team \nhelps improve your organization’s business development \noperations. The White Hat’s objectives are:\n•\t Assess the effectiveness of your sales/capture and \nproposal strategies and messages\n•\t Determine the quality of your competitive intelligence\n•\t Critique your capture and proposal processes\n•\t Evaluate management decisions\nUnlike other reviews that focus on improving your chances \nof winning a specific opportunity, the White Hat focuses on \nimproving your chances of winning future opportunities.\nThe first part of the review focuses on your internal successes, \nproblems, and improvements. Conduct this review while \nmemories are fresh. The second part looks at the pursuit from \nthe customer’s perspective. Incorporate customer feedback \nabout why you won or lost, if available. If not, delay the second \npart of the review until customer feedback is available, likely \nfollowing the award decision.\nConclusions from both portions of the White Hat are \ndocumented and used to improve processes and improve \nperformance. Remember, lessons recorded are not lessons \nlearned unless they motivate change. Figure 7 shows inputs \nand outputs of the White Hat review.\nFigure 7. White Hat Inputs and Outputs. Internal inputs on both successes and problems and their workarounds come from members of the \ncapture and proposal teams after their efforts are complete. External feedback, both formal and informal, comes from customers. Document \nwhat worked well and what did not. Recommend steps and activities to continue and methods or approaches to change.\n8\t\nSELECT APPROPRIATE REVIEWERS AND METHODS FOR  \nEACH COLOR TEAM REVIEW.\nOrganizations must adjust the size and composition of color \nteams based on their organizational structure and resource \navailability. Color team reviewers are managers, staff, \nsubject matter experts, and sometimes outside consultants. \nInclude personnel who have the expertise to contribute to \nthe particular pursuit. Increase the breadth of each review \nby increasing the diversity of reviewers. Minimize reviewers \nwho have been contributors. They seldom maintain clear \nperspectives. Once a review is complete, reviewers can often \nhelp implement recommendations.\nIf your organization values checks and balances, top \nexecutives should contribute primarily to decision gates, not \ncolor teams. When executives become too invested in the \nwork of a color team, they can lose objectivity for subsequent \npursuit decisions and the color team recommendations \nbecome biased by executive input.\nThe following pages suggest who might lead and attend each \ncolor team review and documents and methods to prepare, \ndepending on the size and structure of your organization.\nDocumentation of Successes\nWhite Hat \nReview\nOutputs\nInputs\nInternal Successes\nInternal Problems and \nWorkarounds\nCustomer’s Formal Debriefing\nCustomer’s Informal Comments\nDocumentation of \nProblem Resolutions\nRecommendations for \nProcess Improvements\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n60\n©Shipley Associates\nP I N K  T E A M\nO R G A N I Z E R\n•\t Proposal manager\nC A N D I D AT E  T E A M  M E M B E R S\n•\t Independent, respected Pink Team leader\n•\t Line managers\n•\t Subcontractor executives\n•\t Business development managers\n•\t Subject matter experts\nOT H E R  P OT E N T I A L  AT T E N D E E S\n•\t Capture/opportunity manager\n•\t Program manager\n•\t Sales executive\n•\t Account manager\nP R I M A R Y  D O C U M E N TS\n•\t Competitive assessment\n•\t Capture/opportunity plan\n•\t Request for Proposals/Request for Tender\n•\t Compliance checklist and proposal outline\n•\t Storyboards, content plans, and mockups\nM E T H O D S  TO  CO N S I D E R\n•\t Sequential presentation\n•\t Virtual review of planning documents\n•\t Independent compliance verification\n•\t Walking the wall\nR E D  T E A M\nO R G A N I Z E R\n•\t Proposal manager\nC A N D I D AT E  T E A M  M E M B E R S\n•\t Red Team preparation leader\n•\t Independent Red Team leader\n•\t Executives\n•\t Teammate executives\n•\t Operations personnel\n•\t Subject matter experts\n•\t Customer experts\n•\t Pink Team members\n•\t Capture manager\nP R I M A R Y  D O C U M E N TS\n•\t Final proposal draft\n•\t Customer’s evaluation factors\nM E T H O D S  TO  CO N S I D E R\n•\t Mirror of customer’s evaluation process\n•\t Detailed in-briefing\n•\t Vertical section reviews\n•\t Horizontal reviews of headings, theme statements, \ngraphics and captions, and callouts\n•\t Independent compliance check\n•\t Gadfly review to check for consistency\n•\t Proposal team debriefing\n•\t Core team recovery to minimize personnel involved\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n61\n©Shipley Associates\nG R E E N  T E A M\nO R G A N I Z E R\n•\t Proposal manager\nC A N D I D AT E  T E A M  M E M B E R S\n•\t Executive who must approve price\n•\t Operations personnel\n•\t Pricing manager\n•\t Capture/opportunity manager\nOT H E R  P OT E N T I A L  AT T E N D E E S\n•\t Proposal manager\n•\t Price volume manager\nP R I M A R Y  D O C U M E N TS\n•\t Request for proposals\n•\t Capture/opportunity plan\n•\t Complete solution definition, non-price proposal\n•\t Pricing documents and worksheets\nM E T H O D S  TO  CO N S I D E R\n•\t Pricing spreadsheet review\n•\t Cross-volume comparison\n•\t Closed-door meetings due to closely held information\nG O L D  T E A M\nO R G A N I Z E R\n•\t Proposal manager\nC A N D I D AT E  T E A M  M E M B E R S\n•\t Proposal manager\n•\t Proposal volume managers (if assigned)\n•\t Capture/opportunity manager\n•\t Pricing manager\n•\t Red Team/Green Team leader\nOT H E R  P OT E N T I A L  AT T E N D E E S\n•\t Publication and/or production manager\n•\t Proposal coordinator\nP R I M A R Y  D O C U M E N TS\n•\t Completed proposal, with all letters, documents, \nelectronic files, attachments, other required material\n•\t Red and Green Team action item lists\nM E T H O D S  TO  CO N S I D E R\n•\t Action item check-off\n•\t Horizontal spot checks\n•\t Delivery media evaluation\n\nColor Team Reviews\nShipley Proposal Guide\n62\n©Shipley Associates\nW H I T E  H A T  T E A M\nW H I T E  H A T  T E A M\nO R G A N I Z E R\n•\t Proposal manager\n•\t Capture/opportunity manager\n•\t Sales executive\nC A N D I D AT E  T E A M  M E M B E R S\n•\t Proposal team\n•\t Capture/opportunity team\n•\t Business development management\nOT H E R  P OT E N T I A L  AT T E N D E E S\n•\t Business development process custodian\nP R I M A R Y  D O C U M E N TS\n•\t Internal survey results\n•\t Customer debriefing\nM E T H O D S  TO  CO N S I D E R\n•\t Well-documented team discussions\n•\t Customer debriefing analysis in context of business \ndevelopment lifecycle\n•\t Competitor success/failure analysis\n•\t Standardized survey to compare effort to other pursuits\n•\t Direct, tailored questions about the pursuit\n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n63\n©Shipley Associates\nCompliance means strict adherence to the customer’s bid \nrequest, both the submittal instructions and the requirements. \nResponsiveness means addressing the customer’s underlying \nneeds. Proposals can be responsive but not compliant, or \ncompliant but non-responsive. \nCompliance with instructions means that you have followed \nthe requested format, answered all questions, completed all \nforms, and submitted your response to the right person and \nplace on time. Compliance with requirements means that you \nhave agreed to meet bid request requirements. \nGovernment buyers bound by law can use non-compliance \nas a reason to eliminate your bid. Whether they actually \ndo eliminate your bid varies depending on the relative \ncompliance of the other bidders and governing regulations.\nCommercial buyers are free to ignore or use non-compliance \nas a reason to eliminate a bidder. \nAssuming a responsive proposal addresses the customer’s \nunderlying needs, your approach might be compliant or non-\ncompliant, depending on whether your approach or solution is \nspecified in the bid request:\nA customer needs the grass cut to a specified height. Their bid request \nspecified a weekly cutting by push mower for the calendar year.\n1.\t A compliant but arguably non-responsive bidder could agree to \ncut the grass weekly for 52 weeks, even though the grass might \nbe dormant in winter.\n2.\t A non-compliant but responsive bidder offers to use a robot \nmowing system that senses grass height and cuts as necessary, \nthus keeping the lawn at the desired level but reducing the \nnumber of mowings and perhaps the total cost. \n3.\t Others could offer to cut the grass weekly with a riding mower \nversus the push mower, also noncompliant but responsive. \nAs the examples show, deciding whether to be fully compliant \nand responsive is an implicit question when \ndetermining your solution and strategy. \nCOMPLIANCE AND RESPONSIVENESS\nCompliance and responsiveness are often confused. Both must be addressed.\nSee PROPOSAL \nSTRATEGY.\nCOMPLIANCE AND RESPONSIVENESS\nDo exactly what the customer asks when you \nget to the proposal stage.\nPrepare a compliance checklist for all \nformal bid requests.\nPrepare a compliance checklist for all \ninformally solicited bid requests.\n1\n2\n3\nUse compliance checklist shortcuts with \ncaution and understanding.\nConstruct a response matrix early to help plan \nand track every response.\nSubmit a compliance response locator with your \nproposal to make evaluation easy.\n4\n5\n6\n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n64\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nDO EXACTLY WHAT THE CUSTOMER ASKS WHEN YOU GET TO THE  \nPROPOSAL STAGE.\nDo what the customer requests. Non-compliance is the easiest \nway to eliminate an unwanted bidder.\nSome popular selling methodologies advocate noncompliant \nsolutions. These methodologies suggest that offering a \ncompliant solution puts all power into the customer’s hands, \nenabling the customer to compete on price. They recommend \noffering an innovative, value-added solution that increases the \nseller’s margins. This practice is key.\nNon-compliant solutions can win, providing you are early in \nthe sales process when you can influence the customer to \nmake the specifications less proscriptive or to change the \nspecifications.\nAfter the final bid request is issued, non-compliant solutions \nare riskier. Your degree of risk depends on the restrictiveness \nof the buying rules and the relative power of the individuals \ninfluencing the buying decision. \n2\t\nPREPARE A COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST FOR ALL FORMAL BID REQUESTS.\nCompliance checklists are lists of bid request requirements \nand customer questions that must be answered in your \nproposal. \nCompliance checklists have multiple, evolving uses:\n•\t Clearly identify each requirement and subrequirement \nduring bid request analysis. Missed or poorly scoped \nrequirements might impact bid decisions, risk analysis, \nand pricing.\n•\t Show where each requirement will be addressed in \nthe proposal. Each writer must be given clear writing \nassignments to reduce costly and time-wasting revisions.\n•\t Help proposal reviewers verify a compliant response. \nReviewers will be more efficient, focused, and \nconstructive.\n•\t Form the basis of the response matrices that serve as \nroadmaps to the proposal for evaluators.\nProposal writers and managers may not prepare compliance \nchecklists because “They take too much time when we could \nbe writing the proposal.” \nPreparing compliance checklists and outlines  early in the \nproposal planning process saves more time than they take      \nto prepare. \nThe procedure to prepare a compliance checklist is listed \nbelow. Compliance checklists are most important for large, \nmultilayer bid requests.\nCompliance Checklist Methodology\nFollow the order of topics and paragraphs in the \nbid request. Within paragraphs, follow the order of \nsentences.\nList each requirement as a separate checklist item. \nIf a sentence or paragraph contains two or more \nrequirements, then list each requirement as a \nseparate item.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nUse the customer’s words and phrases in the \nchecklist. Do NOT paraphrase. Use the customer’s \nlanguage.\nBegin each item with the action verb used in the bid \nrequest, such as identify, list, discuss, show, indicate, \ndemonstrate, and describe. These verbs tell the \nproposal writer what the customer wants to see in \nthe proposal.\nUse the compliance checklist as a guide to write \neach section. Base your section outline on the \nchecklist, and follow the order of topics exactly as it \nappears in the checklist.\nPeriodically check to see that every requirement \nhas been met.\n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n65\n©Shipley Associates\nNote how the following compliance checklist example clarifies \nprecisely what the proposal must contain and places each \nrequirement in a separate table row.\nFor guidelines on \nhandling multilayer bid \nrequests, see OUTLINING.\nThe terms compliance \nchecklist, requirements \nchecklist, and compliance \nrequirements checklist \nmean the same thing. \nA response checklist \nis different, however, \nbecause it includes \nthe response to the \ncompliance requirement.\nBid Request Excerpt\n4.2 System Diagnostic Tools\nWhat diagnostic tools are built into your system?  Indicate those that are available only to the network \nmanagement personnel. Indicate those that are available only from the central switch site and those \nthat are available from nodes, terminal locations, etc.\nREFERENCE\nCOMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT\n4.2\nSpecify the diagnostic tools built into our system.\n4.2 \nIndicate the diagnostic tools available only to the network management personnel.\n4.2 \nIndicate the diagnostic tools available only from the central switch site.\n4.2 \nIndicate the diagnostic tools available from nodes, terminal locations, etc.\n3\t\nPREPARE A COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST FOR ALL INFORMALLY  \nSOLICITED BID REQUESTS.\nWhen you do not have a formal bid request, list the customer’s \nrequirements from meetings, phone calls, customer file notes, \nand intelligence resources.\nBy building the compliance checklist collaboratively with the \ncustomer, you offer a valuable service, you can potentially \ninfluence the requirements, and you can reduce surprise \nrequirements and prevent elimination for noncompliance.\nPrepare compliance checklists for informally solicited \nproposals as follows:\n1.\t List the requirements as you understand them.\n2.\t Verify your list and add requirements as you discover \nthem.\n3.\t Prioritize your list by categories.\n4.\t Seek final customer buy-off via a read-through when \npossible.\n5.\t Submit a copy of the final compliance checklist along \nwith your proposal.\nIn some instances, this checklist may become the basis for \na subsequent competitive bid analysis. If so, you have the \nadvantages of more time and influence. For example: \nA commercial property manager was sending an unsolicited letter \nproposal to prospective tenants. A table included in the letter, \nshown below, suggested features that should be required, what \nfeatures were available in the offered property, and provided a place \nto compare competing properties. Based on the features listed, no \ncompeting property could be superior. No seller would list a feature \nthat was not available unless the seller knew the customer did not \nwant that feature.\nRECOMMENDED FEATURES \nSUNSET \nGREEN \n#1\n#2\nCovered parking\n✓\n—\n—\n24 x 7 security\n✓\n—\n—\nMotorway access < 1/4 mile\n✓\n—\n—\nMetro access < 2 blocks\n✓\n—\n—\n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n66\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nUSE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST SHORTCUTS WITH CAUTION \nAND UNDERSTANDING.\nMany potentially time-saving shortcuts are possible. Each \ncarries risk, as summarized in figure 1.\nParsing is the process of \nbuilding the compliance \nchecklist, described in \nguideline 3.\nMETHOD\nADVANTAGES\nDISADVANTAGES\nProposal preparation software does the \nparsing electronically and prepares writer \npackages.\nAppears to be easier, especially on large bid \nrequests.\n•\t Can be expensive and hard to operate.\n•\t Still requires careful review.\n•\t Items can be easily missed.\nElectronically cut and paste requirements \ninto a spreadsheet program.

Comparing Bid Request Parsing Methods. Your choice of shredding method will depend on the size and number of bid requests to \nbe parsed and the risk of potential errors.\n5\t\nCONSTRUCT A RESPONSE MATRIX EARLY TO HELP PLAN AND  \nTRACK EVERY RESPONSE.\nA response matrix, sometimes called a compliance and \nresponse matrix, is a road map for the evaluator that connects \nthe customer’s individual bid request requirements or \nquestions to each specific response in your proposal. \nResponse matrices may also include summary responses and \nindications of compliance or noncompliance.\nPrepare response matrices as a routine part of proposal \nplanning prior to the kickoff meeting. Preparing them just \nbefore submittal is similar to preparing as-built drawings after \nthe building is complete. Both are time consuming, often \nincomplete, and easily skipped. \nThe response matrix shown in figure 2 is the type prepared \nearly in the proposal planning stage. Not all of this matrix \nwould be submitted with the proposal. \nAn expanded bid request compliance matrix, shown in figure \n3, is constructed by the proposal manager to help manage the \npreparation of individual proposal sections. \n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n67\n©Shipley Associates\nVOL II TECH \nPROPOSAL \nSEC/PARA\nPROPOSAL OUTLINE TITLES\nPARA. \nPAGES \n(SUB \nTOTAL)\nSECTION \nPAGES \n(SUB \nTOTAL)\nRESP.  \nAUTHOR\nMUST COMPLY WITH BID REQUEST REQUIREMENTS \nPPI\nEVAL \nCRIT\nSOW \nPARA.\nSPEC \nFNCTNL \nRQMTS\nCDRL\nOTHER BID \nREQUEST \nRQMTS\n2\nTechnical Discussion\n150\nLead\nL043(D)\nM.2.0\n1\n2.1\nTI-SNIPS Concept Selection\n0.25\n3.00\nArthur, D\nL.043(D)\nM.2.1\n1.2\n4\n2.1.1\nConcept Review and Comp\n0.25\nArthur, D\nL.043(D)\nM.2.1\n2.1.2\nConcept Selection\n2.50\nArthur, D\nL.043(D\nM.2.1\n2.2\nPower System Concept\n7.00\n67.25\nArthur, D\nL043(D)\nM.2.2\n4\nWBS 2.04\n2.2.1\nSystem Description\n0.25\nArthur, D\nL043(D)\nM.2.2a\n1.3.1\n2.3.3\nWBS 2.1\n2.2.2\nReactor Subsystem\n8.00\nBradley, R\nL043(D)\nM.2.2a\n1.3.1\n2.3.3\n1.3.4\n1.3.5\nWBS 2.2\n2.2.3\nPower Conversion Subsystem\n8.50\nChristian, J\nL043(D)\nM.2.2b\n1.3.2\n1.2.1, 2\nWBS 2.3\n2.2.4\nDistribution Subsystem\n10.50\nDavidson, \nJ\nL043(D)\nM.2.2c\n1.3.3\n1.3.4\nWBS 2.4\n2.2.4.1\nReaction Control\n8.00\nDavidson, \nJ\nL043(D)\nM.2.2c\n1.3.3.1\n1.2.14\nWBS 2.4.1\n2.2.4.2\nPower Distribution and Cond\n4.00\nDavidson, \nJ\nL043(D)\nM.2.2c\n1.3.3.2\n1.2.14\n2.2.5\nHeat Rejection Subsystem\n7.50\nEvans, G\nL043(D)\nM.2.2d\n1.3.3.3\n1.3.3\n2.2.6\nShielding Subsystem\n7.00\nFreeman, J\nL043(D)\nM.2.2e\n1.3.3.4\n1.2.10\n2.2.7\nPower System-to-Spacecraft I/F\n6.50\n10\nGrand, R\nL043(D)\nM.2.2f\n1.3.3.5\n1.2.5\n2.3\nDesign Maturity and Risk Mitigation\n0.25\nJones, B\nL043(D)\nM.2.3\n1.4\n1.2.16\n2.3.1\nRisk Identification and Red Team\n2.75\nJones, B\nL043(D)\nM.2.3.1\n1.5\n2\n2.3.2\nKey Technology\n1.00\nJones, B\nL043(D)\n1.5\n2.3.3\nCritical Components\n4.00\nJones, B\nL043(D)\n1.6\n2.3.4\nTI-SNIPS Flight Demo Prog\n2.00\nJones, B\nL043(D)\n1.7\n1.2.3\n7\n2.4\nProjected Performance\n0.25\n10\nHanks, T\nL043(D)\nM.2.4\n1.2\n1.2\n4\n2.4.1\nPerformance Requirements\n0.25\nHanks, T\nL043(D)\n1.2\n1.2\n4\n2.4.1.1\nPower Level\n0.50\nHanks, T\nL043(D)\n1.2.1\n1.2.1\n2.4.1.2\nPower Density\n0.50\nHanks, T\nL043(D)\n1.2.2\n1.2.2\nTotal\n81.75\n90.25\nFigure 2.

Expanded Bid Request Compliance Matrix. Expanded bid request compliance matrices are used on large, complex responses with \nmultiple writers. Managers, writers, and reviewers find them useful to develop a coordinated, coherent response with minimum revision. Note \nthat many of the words in the requirements column are abbreviated to reduce the size of the table.\n\nCompliance and Responsiveness\nShipley Proposal Guide\n69\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nSUBMIT A COMPLIANCE RESPONSE LOCATOR WITH YOUR PROPOSAL  \nTO MAKE EVALUATION EASY.\nThe compliance response locator, shown in figure 4, is \nsubmitted as part of the proposal. This tool simplifies the \nevaluator’s task of quickly finding where your proposal \naddresses each requirement specified in the bid request. \nAdditional columns are often added that summarize whether \nthe response is compliant. If you are worried about being \ncapriciously eliminated for non-compliance, consider the \nhairsplitting, Compliant with qualification.\nAnother best practice is to place a Why us? summary on the \nfirst page of every volume or major section of a proposal. \nThis summary is usually a table that relates the key customer \nrequirements, your offering, and your unique discriminator(s). \nThis table helps evaluators tie your offering to their needs and \nmakes it easy for them to justify selecting your solution. If you \ncannot convince them in one page, you need to refine your \nsolution. \nBID REQUEST REQUIREMENT\nPROPOSAL RESPONSE\nSection Title\nTitle\nL.24(b)(3)(i)a.\nL.24(b)(3)(i)b.\nL.24(b)(3)(i)c.\nL.24(b)(3)(i)d.\nL.24(b)(3)(i)e.\nL.24(b)(3)(ii)\nL.24(b)(3)(iii)\nL.24(b)(3)(iv)\nL.24(b)(3)(v)\nL.24(b)(3)(vi)\nL.24(b)(3)(vii)\nSOW 3.1\nSOW 3.2\nSOW 3.3\nSOW 3.4\nSOW 3.5\nSOW 3.6\nSOW 3.7\nSOW 3.8\nSOW 3.9\nSOW 3.10\nSOW 3.11\nTechnical Approach\nUnderstanding of Goals/Objectives\nUnderstanding of Configurational . . .\nUnderstanding of Goals/Objectives\nUnderstanding of Goals/Objectives\nTechnical Approach/Methodology\nInnovation\nStudy Plan\nStudy Schedule\nKey Personnel\nStudy Manager\nTask Completion Schedule\nReview Candidate GGSF Exper\nAnalyses of Candidate GGSF Exper\nIdentify Facility Subsystems\nAssess GGSF and MCPF Tech Area\nCritical Supporting Areas\nIssues Requiring Further Study\nIdentify Freedom Subsystems\nRqmts for Use of A1 Expert Systems\nAssess Facility Mission Rqmts\nFinal Report\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.1–2.5\n3.1\n3.2\n4.1\n4.2\nApp.\n5.2, App.\n4.2\n2.1.1.1, 3.1.1\n2.1.1.1, 2.1.2.1, 3.1.1\n2.2, 2.3.2, 3.1.1\n3.1.1.3\n2.1.1.2, 2.2, 2.5.3, 3.1.1, 3.2\n3.1.1.2\n2.4\n2.3.2, 3.2\n2.2, 3.1.1, 4.2\n4.1\nFigure 4.

Waiting until page numbers are firm puts too much \nwork at the end. Section numbers are sufficient.\n\nCover Letters\nShipley Proposal Guide\n70\n©Shipley Associates\nCover letters should reflect the key \nthemes found on the first page of your \nexecutive summary but be far less \ncomprehensive. The focus of the cover \nletter will depend on the reader. \nWhen the person receiving the proposal \nhas a role in selecting the winner, \nthe cover letter presents another \nopportunity to sell the value proposition. \nFor a large, multivolume proposal shipped in several boxes, \ninclude a letter of transmittal that serves as a packing list to \ntell the person who accepts delivery what is included. \nCover letters should also be attached on proposals submitted \nelectronically or through an acquisition portal.\nCOVER LETTERS\nCover letters are a common part of most proposal submittals. While cover letters have relatively little influence on the evaluation \nteam when compared to the executive summary, they are conspicuous by their absence. A cover letter often addresses a senior \nleader in the customer organization.\nCOVER LETTERS\nUse your cover letter to cite your key discriminator, \ndirectly tied to a key customer need.\nHave the cover letter signed by a senior leader in \nyour organization recognizable to the customer.\n1\n2\nIn a single page, include two or three powerful \nreasons to select your offer.\nClose with a short paragraph that points the reader \nto specific information in your proposal.\n3\n4\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\nThree model cover \nletters are included \nin the MODEL \nDOCUMENTS \nsection.\nUse the four-box \norganizational \nstructure, described \nin ORGANIZATION.\nSee CHOOSING \nCORRECT WORDS \nand CUSTOMER \nFOCUS.\nOpen with a customer-focused theme \nstatement like the opening to your \nexecutive summary:\nReadyMaids.com can continue to focus on the \nexplosive growth in home cleaning services by selecting an informa-\ntion technology (IT) support vendor like Global Information Technolo-\ngy (GIT), with an entire division specializing in franchise support.\nAvoid opening with the cliches:\nThank you for the opportunity to submit our proposal for IT support.\nAlso avoid this seller-focused opener:\nGlobal Information Technology is pleased to present our proposal for \nIT support.\n1\t\nUSE YOUR COVER LETTER TO CITE YOUR KEY DISCRIMINATOR, DIRECTLY TIED TO \nA KEY CUSTOMER NEED.\n\nCover Letters\nShipley Proposal Guide\n71\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nHAVE THE COVER LETTER SIGNED BY A SENIOR LEADER IN YOUR ORGANIZATION \nRECOGNIZABLE TO THE CUSTOMER.\nSkeptical customers know that a cover letter signed by the CEO \nof a multibillion-dollar organization simply means someone \nwrote a letter and got it signed. \nDraft it early and have it signed by an influential person in \nyour organization that the customer knows. Reinforce this \ncontact during the capture phase by arranging a meaningful \ninterchange between the signer and a senior person in the \ncustomer’s organization. Then reference the meeting in your \ncover letter:\nIn our meeting on October 15, Superintendent Austin indicated that \nthe Sunrise District was looking for a partner that understood the \nneeds of metropolitan school districts. \n3\t\nIN A SINGLE PAGE, INCLUDE TWO OR THREE POWERFUL REASONS TO SELECT \nYOUR OFFER.\nCite any value-added aspects of your offer that save time, \nsave money, or reduce risk. Cite any special efforts you have \ntaken to address key customer concerns. Reinforce any unique \nexperience or outstanding performance with the customer’s \norganization or a similar organization. Carefully avoid using a \npatronizing or arrogant tone.\n4\t\nCLOSE WITH A SHORT PARAGRAPH THAT POINTS THE READER TO SPECIFIC  \nINFORMATION IN YOUR PROPOSAL.\nKeep your closing paragraph short. Include the project name \nand RFP number, give a contact person and number, and cite \nterms such as how long your offer is valid.\nAvoid closing with a legal-sounding paragraph that essentially \nsays you are not responsible for anything. Consider adding the \nfollowing to a concise closing paragraph:\n•\t Note what is included in your proposal.\n•\t Include a contact name, address, and number.\n•\t Indicate how long your offer is valid.\n•\t Cite special terms or conditions.\n•\t Cite the contract name and RFP number.\n•\t Indicate the signing person is authorized to make this offer.\n\nCustomer Focus\nShipley Proposal Guide\n72\n©Shipley Associates\nWhat features make one proposal more customer-focused \nthan another? Do different individuals perceive customer focus \ndifferently? Do individuals with different cultural backgrounds \nor positions perceive customer focus differently?\nTo determine the answer, we asked individuals to rank the \ncustomer focus of five documents. \nThe base document was a 2-page \nexecutive summary. For each of the \nfive documents, appearance and \ncontent were fixed while writing and \norganization varied. Figure 1 lists \nthe controlled and variable features \nof the five test documents. All five \nversions were by the same seller \nto the same customer for the same \nproducts and services. \nTo date, more than 7,000 people \nfrom 40 countries and 5 continents have completed this \nexercise in English, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, Danish, \nSwedish, and French. The results have been consistent across \ncultures:\n1.\t Seventy percent ranked the same document as most \ncustomer-focused.\n2.\t The composite ordinal ranking (most customer-focused \nto least) was consistent from group to group. \n3.\t The least customer-focused version was ranked last by \n80 percent of the participants.\n4.\t About one-half of the participants could cite specific \naspects of the writing that explained their ranking.\nEight guidelines indicate how to increase the perceived \ncustomer focus of a document. Readers rate a document’s \ncustomer focus higher when more of the guidelines are \nfollowed and when the guidelines are followed more \nfrequently.\nCUSTOMER FOCUS\nCustomer focus is a communication trait that everyone claims but few convey. When someone in a business development role is \nasked, “Are you customer focused?” the usual answer is, “Of course!”\nThese guidelines to \nimproving the customer \nfocus of sales documents \nare relevant and \nimportant when applied \nto executive summaries \nand sales letters as well \nas individual proposal \nsections.\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY; and SALES \nCOMMUNICATION, \nCapture Guide.\nV A R I A B L E  F E A T U R E S\nPage layout\nFonts\nAction captions\nQuotes from users\nC O N T R O L L E D  F E A T U R E S\nCites customer’s buying vision\nLinks customer’s vision to the immediate opportunity\nCites the customer’s hot buttons (issues, needs)\nMakes ownership of the hot buttons explicit\nAddresses each hot button in the order cited\nNames the customer before the seller\nNames the customer more often than the seller\nCites benefits before features\nFigure 1. Customer Focus Research Experiment. To determine which document features most affect the reader’s perception of customer \nfocus, five test documents were created with the same controlled features and different variable features.

Cascadia Timber Chairman, Woody X. Pine, set \nthe following strategic direction:\nWe have to do everything better, more efficiently from a cost point of \nview, more effectively from an impact point of view.\n\t\nCascadia Timber Annual Report, 20XX\nToo many proposal writers demonstrate their understanding \nof the customer’s needs by copying a few paragraphs from the \nbid request, demonstrating only that they can copy and paste.\nNumerous studies of buyers have found that while nearly all \nbidders are technically qualified, the proposal selected was \nthe one that stated the best understanding of the customer’s \nbusiness.\n2\t\nLINK THE CUSTOMER’S VISION DIRECTLY TO THE IMMEDIATE PURCHASE.\nConnecting the customer’s buying vision to the immediate \nopportunity demonstrates understanding. After your offer is \nselected, the direct link to the organization’s vision may help \nthe project get funded over other, unrelated but competing \nprojects.\nCascadia Timber’s Forest Management Division helps improve  \nefficiency and effectiveness by adopting innovative forest  \nmanagement practices.\nBuyers sometimes get so close to the immediate project \nthat they lose perspective and focus on features rather than \nbenefits.\n\nCustomer Focus\nShipley Proposal Guide\n74\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nCITE THE CUSTOMER’S HOT BUTTONS (NEEDS, ISSUES).\nCiting the customer’s hot buttons immediately places the \nfocus on what the customer needs instead of what you are \nselling. Hot buttons are a combination of issues, needs, \nrequirements, and evaluation criteria. To develop a hot button \nlist of two to four items, do the following:\n1.\t List all the major hot buttons you uncovered during  \nthe selling process.\n2.\t Group similar hot buttons to reduce the list to two  \nto four items.\n3.\t Restate the grouped hot buttons using the  \ncustomer’s words.\nNote how the following example continues from the previous \nexample connecting the vision and the immediate need, then \ntransitioning into the hot buttons:\nIn support of Cascadia Timber’s strategic direction, the Forest \nManagement Division verbally requested proposals for 20 \ndrones to be used as a forest management tool. In our meet-\nings with Forest Management and purchasing, individuals \ncited four primary needs:\n1.\t Affordable, portable, and easily transportable \n2.\t All-conditions observation and communication platform\n3.\t Safe and easy to fly\n4.\t Easy to maintain in the field\nIMMEDIATE NEED\nHOT BUTTONS\n4\t\nMAKE CUSTOMER OWNERSHIP OF THE HOT BUTTONS EXPLICIT.\nMake ownership of hot buttons explicit by citing your source, \npreferably in the customer’s organization.\nThe following statement lacks ownership:\nThe ideal drone must meet four primary needs: . . .\nThe following makes ownership explicit:\nIn our meetings with Forest Management and Purchasing, leadership \ncited four primary needs: . . .\nEven if you have had no contact with the customer, you can \nsoften the statement by broadening your source:\nIn our experience with other, similar forest management organiza-\ntions, most cited four primary needs: . . .\nAvoid making statements like this, which can be interpreted as \narrogant:\nCascadia Timber needs to improve forest management by purchasing \na drone with the following features: . . .\n5\t\nADDRESS EACH HOT BUTTON IN THE ORDER CITED.\nAfter announcing the proposal’s or section’s \norganization with the customer’s hot \nbutton list, follow it in exact order. Make \nsubheadings identical to the hot buttons. \nUse the same words. \nFailing to follow your announced organization may confuse or \ndisorient the evaluator.\nThe following example shows how a hot button list is reflected \nin subsequent subheadings.\nSee MODEL \nDOCUMENTS \nfor the complete \nexample.\nH OT  B U T TO N  L I S T\nYou Cited Four Primary Needs:\n1.\t Affordable, portable, and easily transportable \n2.\t All-conditions observation and communication \nplatform\n3.\t Safe and easy to fly\n4.\t Easy to maintain in the field\n1.\t Affordable, Portable, and Easily Transportable\n2. \tAll-Conditions Observation and \nCommunication Platform\n3.

Do they tend to open with the words We, Our, or \nyour organization’s or product’s name?\nSeller-focused example (not customer-focused)\nAirwind (seller) can reduce Cascadia Timber's cost of forest  \nmanagement in remote, roadless areas by supplying 20 versatile \ndrones and proven Airwind long-term support.\nCustomer-focused example\nCascadia Timber's (customer) can reduce the cost of forest  \nmanagement in remote, roadless areas by selecting a partner to sup-\nply 20 versatile drones that also offers proven long-term support.\nThe seller was not named in the second example. The words \na partner could have been replaced with the seller’s name \nAirwind. Because the reader clearly knows whose proposal it \nis, naming the seller again is not \nnecessary. Both are correct. Using \npartner softens the tone. \nWhen discussing your \norganization, try to state what \nothers say, not what you say \nabout yourself. Contrast these two \nstatements:\nSeller-focused example\nColossal has 75 percent of the widget market.\nCustomer-focused example\nSeventy-five percent of widget users \nselected Colossal.\nPartner can have positive \nor negative connotations, \ndepending on the customer. \nAvoid using jargon unless \nthe customer requests a \npartner.\nSee CHOOSING CORRECT \nWORDS.\n7\t\nNAME THE CUSTOMER AS MANY OR MORE TIMES THAN THE SELLER.\nStrive to mention the customer as many or more times than \nyou mention your organization. Pronouns are considered as a \nmention in your proposal.\nAvoid making the proposal “all about us.” By mentioning \nthe customer name more than your name, you increase the \ncustomer’s engagement and connection to your message.\n8\t\nCITE BENEFITS BEFORE FEATURES.\nFollowing basic organizational principles, begin with items of \ngreatest interest to the customer, the benefit rather than the \nfeature.\nNote the difference in these proposal excerpts:\nAirwind (seller) is offering 20 Endeavor drones for $25,500 each, \nless than one-half the cost of a 3/4-ton 4-wheel drive truck. This can \nreduce the cost of forest management. The Endeavor offers a unique \ncombination of features:\n1.\t The wings, tail assembly, and technology are oriented along a \nslim axis and secured in a rugged transport case for portability.\n2.\t One person can carry the drone for easy transportability.\nCompare the preceding excerpt with a \nmore customer-focused version:\nCascadia Timber (customer) can reduce the cost of forest manage-\nment by purchasing 20 Endeavor drones from Airwind for $25,500 \neach, less than one-half the cost of 3/4-ton four-wheel drive trucks. \nThe Endeavor offers a unique combination of features:\n1.\t For portability, the wings, tail assembly, and technology are \noriented along a slim axis and secured in a rugged transport \ncase.\n2.\t For easy transportability, one person can carry the drone.\nGuidelines 6 through 8 are complementary. Citing benefits \nfirst tends to pull in the customer’s name first. Closing with a \nbenefit tends to place the customer’s name last.\nSee \nORGANIZATION.\n\nDaily Proposal Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n76\n©Shipley Associates\nDAILY PROPOSAL TEAM MANAGEMENT\nThe difficulties of managing a proposal team are compounded \nwhen the following conditions exist:\n•\t Large team\n•\t Dispersed team (virtual)\n•\t Part-time members\n•\t Members from different organizations or teaming \npartners\n•\t Untrained, inexperienced members\nThe bid or proposal manager has three key tools to keep the \nteam on schedule:\n1.\t Proposal Management Plan (PMP)\n2.\t Daily or regular stand-up meeting\n3.\t Content plans, including storyboards or mockup tools \nThe proposal manager’s primary objective is to prepare a \nwinning document, on time and within budget. Establish a \npattern of short, regular team and individual status checks that \noften include checking on solution development progress. \nDaily proposal team management activities must be tailored \nby team conditions, size of and complexity the proposal, and \navailable budget and resources.\nSee PROPOSAL  \nMANAGEMENT PLAN \nand STORYBOARDS \nAND MOCKUPS: \nCONTENT PLANNING \nTOOLS.\nDAILY PROPOSAL TEAM MANAGEMENT\nPrepare a Proposal Management Plan.\nDefine and document your solution early.\nConfirm that all contributors \nunderstand their assignments.\n1\n2\n3\nConduct daily or regular stand-up meetings \nwith the proposal contributors.\n4\nFocus team members on their \nnext, immediate task.\nUse content plans to track the progress \nof individual contributors.\nReview content progress each day and \nbe accesible to your contributors.\n5\n6\n7\nDaily proposal team management is focused on efficiently executing the proposal management plan. Agility in monitoring \nprogress and identifying problems or challenges early minimizes the cost of corrective action. Daily reviews and stand-up \nsessions allow for tasks to be reviewed in parallel while working toward more formal proposal reviews.\n\nDaily Proposal Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n77\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nPREPARE A PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT PLAN.\nGood proposal plans are detailed, documented, and available \nfor review and reference. Poor plans are those that stay in \nthe manager’s head. Evidence of a quality plan is one that is \ndocumented and can be both reviewed and used as a daily \nmanagement tool. \nSelect a platform that is compatible with your organization. \nProposal management plans are rarely a single document. \nIncreasingly, proposal management plans comprise multiple \nfiles that are accessible to appropriate virtual proposal team \nmembers.\nThe shorter the response time, the greater \nthe need to plan because you have limited \nrecovery time.\nEven abbreviated planning is essential on quick-turn \nresponses. At a minimum, make clear assignments and \nleverage content planning to ensure compliance and  \ncustomer focus.\nSee PROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT \nPLAN.\n2\t\nDEFINE AND DOCUMENT YOUR SOLUTION EARLY.\nGood proposals are strengthened when a clear, documented \nsolution exists. Good proposals are difficult with an unclear, \nundocumented solution. Solution development should  \nevolve as the proposal response evolves with iterative, r \negular review cycles.\nProposal planning includes an understanding of the baseline \nsolution. If you begin writing the proposal before the solution \nis at least partially defined, the result will be a response full of \ngeneric descriptions, boilerplate, and “trust me” statements, \nall completely lacking in customer focus.\n3\t\nCONFIRM THAT ALL CONTRIBUTORS UNDERSTAND THEIR ASSIGNMENTS.\nThe proposal kickoff meeting is where contributors to a \nproposal must receive answers to basic questions:\n1.\t What is my task?\n2.\t How do you want it done?\n3.\t When and how often will it be reviewed? \n4.\t When is it due?\n5.\t How do I charge my time?\nToo many organizations mistakenly use the proposal kickoff \nmeeting as a planning meeting rather than to establish clear \ntask assignments.\nAfter making assignments, immediately \nfollow up with contributors to confirm they \nunderstand their assignment in the context \nof the entire proposal. Be agile in your approach to tracking \nprogress.\nA responsibility matrix shown in figure 1 is closely related to \nthe bid request compliance matrix. Use a responsibility matrix \nto track the status of each writing assignment by author and \ndue date. Use regular status checks to monitor progress.\nThe complexity of the matrix varies with the complexity of the \nproposal.\nSee KICKOFF \nMEETINGS.\nPROPOSAL\nPAR #\nPROPOSAL \nSECTION\nRELEVANT \nBID \nREQUEST \nPAR #\nAUTHOR\nPAGE \nLIMIT \nTARGET\nSTORYBOARD \nASSIGNED\nFIRST \nREVIEW\nFINAL \nDATE\nMOCKUP \nREVIEW \nDATE\nPINK \nTEAM\nGRAPHICS \nDUE DATE\nFIRST \nDRAFT\nRED TEAM \nDATE\nNone\n Exec Sum\nIntro\nS.

When issues surface that need \ndiscussion, determine who needs to participate, set a time to \nmeet, then move to the next item. Record all actions assigned.\nThe proposal manager conducts the \nmeeting, supported by others when \nassigned. Peer reviews can be a valuable tool.\n Potential stand-up topics include the following:\n•\t Upcoming milestones\n•\t Action items\n•\t Procedural changes\n•\t New customer information\n•\t Teaming or subcontract considerations\n•\t Solution refinements\n•\t Solution milestones or schedules\n•\t Strategy refinements\n•\t Changes in the bid request, proposal outline, or response \nassignments\n•\t Graphics, editing, or publication support issues\nDo not who assume that everything is on track because “I have \nnot heard about any problems from contributors.” Reach out \nto the team frequently and be available for when they reach \nout to you. \nThe term “stand-up” \ncomes from the idea that \nforcing participants to \nstand would keep the \nmeeting brief. \n \nSee TEAM SELECTION  \nAND MANAGEMENT.\nSee VIRTUAL TEAM  \nMANAGEMENT.\n5\t\nFOCUS TEAM MEMBERS ON THEIR NEXT, IMMEDIATE TASK.\nProposal contributors do better with smaller tasks and shorter \ndeadlines than with a few large tasks and longer deadlines. \nIf task deadlines are set by day, contributors interpret the \ndeadline to be close of business on the date.\nPresent a high-level milestone schedule \nshowing major events at the proposal \nkickoff meeting or the next subsequent meeting with the \nproposal team. Within a few days, turn the milestone schedule \ninto a more detailed schedule. A more detailed schedule \ndivides major tasks into smaller, clearly defined subtasks. Give \neveryone a due date and time for each assigned task. Track \nand monitor parallel tasks as they are completed.\nUse the stand-up meeting to reinforce progress, commend \nexcellent work, and remind contributors what needs to be \ndone that day. Hold contributors accountable to deliverables.  \nDetailed schedules help keep contributors focused on \nimmediate tasks, giving a sense of immediacy and completion.\nSee SCHEDULING.\n6\t\nUSE CONTENT PLANS TO TRACK THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS.\nContent plans, including storyboards and mockup tools, are \nalso powerful management tools.\nUse available document \ncollaboration tools and sites to \ntrack progress and changes. You \nwill quickly spot contributors who are falling behind task. \nIf content plans are incomplete with significant gaps, it is a \nsignal that they need help developing their assigned section.\nSee STORYBOARDS AND \nMOCKUPS: CONTENT \nPLANNING TOOLS.\n\nDaily Proposal Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n79\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nREVIEW CONTENT PROGRESS EACH DAY AND BE ACCESSIBLE TO  \nYOUR CONTRIBUTORS.\nProposal managers need a method to achieve consistency, \nflexibility, and compatibility across all proposal sections.\nTrying to read all the draft content daily becomes \noverwhelming. Instead, focus on reviewing a single aspect of \nall sections each day.\nSelect a member of your core team to review content plans \nand drafts with you.

They are the \nfeatures of your offer that differ from the features of a \ncompetitor’s offer. Differentiators are \noften called unique selling points.\nHowever, if the difference does not \nmatter to the customer, it is not \nimportant. Hence, discriminators \nare differentiators that are acknowledged by the customer as \nimportant. \nThe strongest discriminators are true for you and not true for \nany of your competitors. The weakest discriminators are true \nfor you and not true for at least one of your competitors. \nThe strength of a discriminator also depends on its importance \nto the customer. The CEO of a large defense contractor once \nsaid, “We must identify at least one truly unique discriminator \nto justify bidding.”\nIf the customer cannot identify discriminators among \nthe various offers, then low price becomes the remaining \ndiscriminator. However, most buyers say that relatively small \ndifferences among offers become the discriminators among \nthe winner and the losers.\nDISCRIMINATORS\nIdentify discriminators by understanding your \ncustomer, your competitors, and your own \ncapabilities.\nIdentify both positive and negative discriminators \nand position them as positively as possible.\nContinuously reexamine whether a \ndiscriminator still discriminates.\n1\n2\n3\nDevelop discriminators by continuing to \ndefine them more specifically.\nEmphasize people, experience, performance, \nand understanding of the customer’s business.\n4\n5\nDiscriminators are features of your offer or solution that (1) differ from a competitor’s offer and (2) are acknowledged by \nthe customer as important. Both conditions must be met. \nIf you are not certain \nif your features are \ndiscriminators, see \nFEATURES, ADVANTAGES, \nAND BENEFITS.\n1\t\nIDENTIFY DISCRIMINATORS BY UNDERSTANDING YOUR CUSTOMER,  \nYOUR COMPETITORS, AND YOUR OWN CAPABILITIES.\nWhen you rent a car, do you ask about the color of the car?  No.  \nWhen you purchase a car, do you ask about the color of the car?  Yes.\nIf the above statements are true, paint color is a discriminator \nwhen you buy but not when you rent.\nMany sellers have either not seen what their competitors offer \nor rely on obsolete data about their competitors. When you \nclaim to have a unique approach but do not, then you lose \ncredibility with your customer.\n\nDiscriminators\nShipley Proposal Guide\n81\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nIDENTIFY BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DISCRIMINATORS AND POSITION THEM \nAS POSITIVELY AS POSSIBLE.\nMany proposal writers focus exclusively on their positive \ndiscriminators. Also identify and deal with your negative ones:\nNegative discriminator\nOur company employs the highest number of SaaS security  \nresearchers. Recently, one of our servers was breached internally, \nendangering several hundred sensitive files. Our client then spent \n$100 million to determine the breach and enhance our Cloud Access \nSecurity Broker (CASB) to prevent similar issues in the future, with  \nour assistance. \nClearly, the seal failure is a major negative discriminator. A \npossible reply:\nAs the company with the highest number of SaaS security researchers \nand after spending $100 million strengthening our CASB technology, \ncan you afford to teach another supplier how to better fortify their \nsecurity measures?\nWhile possibly too direct for some in a written proposal, the \nexample illustrates how you can emphasize the positive side of \nyour negative discriminators.\nMany procurements have been lost because the seller \nassumed the reason they won the last contract still applied. \nConsider these examples:\nDecaffeinated coffee is far more popular in the evening than in the \nmorning. \nHere, the power of discriminators to an individual is cyclical \nover a day.\nA major engine manufacturer won a large \norder by selling a replacement engine that \noffered greater thrust. In the next competition, they followed the same \nstrategy, offering increased thrust as their key discriminator. They lost \nwhen the customer calculated the life-cycle cost of the additional fuel \nand judged it more important than increased thrust.\nHere the customer’s perceived needs changed. Also, the \ndecision makers may have changed from users to the \neconomic buyers.\nThe power of the \ndiscriminator to an \nindividual may vary \nover time.\n3\t\nCONTINUOUSLY REEXAMINE WHETHER A DISCRIMINATOR  \nSTILL DISCRIMINATES.\nEven worse, many proposal writers know so little about what \nthey offer that they describe it generically:\nWe offer an experienced network technician.\nThis claim doesn’t explain the experience of the technician or \nhow the customer will benefit.\nCustomers, often not experts in what they are buying, need \nhelp to determine the importance of your discriminators. \nWhen you do not know specifically what your competitor \noffers, discriminate your features against other criteria, \nlike national averages, independent study results, or other \napproaches that you considered but rejected as inferior. \nConsider these good examples:\nOur job site safety record shows that we experience 50 percent fewer \nlost-time accidents than the national average for comparable con-\nstruction activity.\nWhile not all outsourced employees will choose to transition to a new \nsupport vendor, independent studies by the Acme Group show that \nour job offer acceptance rate is 14 percent above the industry average \nand that our retention rate long-term is equal to the retention rate of \nnew employees.\nWe considered using a fast-track construction approach, which \ninitially appeared to cut four weeks from the construction schedule. \nHowever, after studying the local permitting review and approval pro-\ncess, we decided it might offend state regulatory officials and actually \nincrease the risk of expensive schedule delays.\n4\t\nDEVELOP DISCRIMINATORS BY CONTINUING TO DEFINE THEM  \nMORE SPECIFICALLY.\nNote the progression from generic to specific:\nExperienced manager.\nExperienced project manager.\nAll project managers have a minimum of 10 years of experience.\nFred Jones, our proposed manager, has 10 years of project manage-\nment experience.\nFred Jones, our proposed project manager, also managed the similar \nNorth Cove project to a within-budget, on-time delivery.\n\nDiscriminators\nShipley Proposal Guide\n82\n©Shipley Associates\nEach person is unique. If the customer \nvalues the differences in the abilities of \nthe individuals you propose, use these \ndifferences as discriminators.\nFrequently, sellers throw away the opportunity to use \nindividuals as their discriminators by stating:\nAll our people are good; it does not matter who you get. \nBy the time the contract is awarded, we do not know who will actually \nbe available.\nWe do not have a Big Name like our competitors, so we will not name \nanyone. We do not play bait-and-switch.\nMaximize the customer’s interest in the individuals you \npropose by building a rapport between the \ncustomer and these key individuals before \nthe bid request is issued.\nConsider your own purchase of skilled \nservices, such as selecting the person \nor company to remodel your home. Nearly everyone in this \nsituation wants to know, “Who will actually be in my home \ndoing the work while I am away?”\nNo two companies have been awarded the same jobs,  \nso your specific experience is different. If you can  \npersuade the customer to care about the difference, you  \nhave a discriminator. \nExtend your discussions of experience and performance \nbeyond the appendix, experience, or past performance sections \nof the proposal. Cite experience and performance throughout \nyour proposal to substantiate all claims. Use a Success Story \nTemplate such as the one found in guideline 4 of Relevant \nExperience/Past Performance, to present your experience and \nperformance in a customer-focused manner.\nMost customers for complex systems and services can readily \nidentify several organizations with sufficient talent, expertise, \nand resources. \nThe critical discriminator is often an understanding of the \ncustomer’s business, vision, and immediate needs. The winner \nis often the selling organization that best shows how it can \nhelp the customer achieve its strategic vision. \nDiscriminate your solution by demonstrating your \nunderstanding of the customer’s business throughout your \nentire proposal. Do not limit integrating discriminators to the \nexecutive summary and sales briefing.\n5\t\nEMPHASIZE PEOPLE, EXPERIENCE, PERFORMANCE, AND UNDERSTANDING OF \nTHE CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS.\nA writer in a national proposal publication coined the phrase \n“generic specific,” words that sound specific but are really \ngeneric. Discriminate by being specific and offering proof.\nGeneric Specific Language\nThe program manager will regularly review the risk log with the pro-\ngram team and pursue mitigation actions as needed.\nSpecific Language Revision\nDave Lee, Program Manager, will review the risk log every Friday and \npublish corrections on the program website by close of business on \nthe following Monday.\nWhat is the real meaning of a discriminator like the following?\n200 years of experience on our team\nDoes the team include 20 people with 10 years of experience \neach or 200 people with 1 year of experience each? Be specific \nby quantifying, if possible. \nConsider another example:\nImproved fuel economy\nA proposal may fail to quantify because writers do not know \nhow much fuel economy will improve, they are too lazy to find \nout, or they do not want to be held accountable.\nBe as specific as possible. Oddly enough, the claim of a 14.5 \npercent improvement is more credible than a 15 percent claim, \nappearing to be more precise. \nSee RELEVANT \nEXPERIENCE/PAST \nPERFORMANCE.\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY, and \nFEATURES,  \nADVANTAGES, AND \nBENEFITS.\n\nElectronic Submittal\nShipley Proposal Guide\n83\n©Shipley Associates\nThe appropriate submittal format depends on how the \nelectronic submittal will be used. If you can influence the \ncustomer, recommend the following formats based on the \ncustomer’s objectives:\n•\t To archive, the seller’s format should be sufficient, \nproviding it is prepared with a widely available package.\n•\t To support the paper-version evaluation, PDF is the \npreferred choice. The PDF format is a universally accepted \nfile type that enables evaluators to search text, copy, \npaste, print, and view the entire page with integrated \ngraphics and text.\n•\t To enable paperless evaluation, most available \ncommercial packages will generate PDF files.\nSubmission delivery refers to how the customer wants the \nelectronic version delivered—most commonly through a \nprocurement or online sourcing system, email, or flash drive, \nalthough some customers still require copies to be provided \non CD-ROM or DVD. Regardless of delivery method, be aware \nof file size, security, time stamping, and return receipts.\nFor federal bids, purchasers from U.S. government agencies \nimpose page limits to reduce the evaluation effort required \nand the time and cost to prepare the proposal. \nIncreasingly, file size matters. Many \nquick-turn task order bids under \nIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity \n(IDIQ) contracts require only electronic \nsubmittals. The bid request might \nimpose file size limits or the customer’s \nemail server might have a file size \nlimit. Check with your customer for \nfile size restrictions. PDF files are \nrecommended to help reduce file size \nwhile maintaining the overall look of \nthe proposal.\nGraphics file sizes vary depending \non whether they are pixel or raster \nbased. Scanned images can be large, \ndepending on the resolution.\nAbout the only meaningful limitation that is relevant to the \nindividual evaluator is the number of pages, whether physical \nor viewed on-screen.\nEven though a proposal is submitted electronically, the \nevaluator may print and evaluate from a hard copy of  \nthe proposal.\nELECTRONIC SUBMITTAL\nElectronic submittal of proposals is increasing and is often the only delivery method or may be a backup to paper submittal.\nCompliance means strict adherence to the customer’s bid request, both the submittal instructions and the requirements. \nBecause the \ntechnology of \nelectronic submittal \nwill continue to evolve \nrapidly, this entry \nmay be obsolete after \npublishing. \nGood sources of \ncurrent information \nare various federal \nagency websites and \nthe Association of \nProposal Management \nProfessionals (APMP) \nat www.apmp.org.\nSee PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT DESIGN. \nELECTRONIC SUBMITTAL\nFollow each customer’s submittal \ninstructions exactly.\nUse the  PDF file format \nwhenever possible.\n1\n2\n3\nUse graphic files that offer adequate \nresolution for printing or viewing.\nLearn and test all electronic systems early \nin the preparation process.\nUse consistency in file naming to help \norganize your submittal\n5\n6\n7\nUse forced page breaks to control \npagination.\n4\nConsider a landscape, PDF format for proposals that \nwill be reviewed on-screen.\n\nElectronic Submittal\nShipley Proposal Guide\n84\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nFOLLOW EACH CUSTOMER’S SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.\nFollowing the rules is not optional. Buy the hardware or \nsoftware required to conform or do not bid. Use the software \npackages, versions, or releases specified. If none are specified \nand you do not know what the customer uses, ask. \nCreate a plan for meeting the customer’s \nsubmittal instructions, including file \norganization, file type, file size, and file naming. Incorporate \nthese requirements into your pre-submittal checklist notes. \nMeeting the customer's requirements and producing and \norganized submittal package allows your customer to easily \naccess and evaluate your proposal, as well as identify  \nyour compliance.\n2\t\nUSE THE PDF FILE FORMAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE.\nFiles prepared in most common word-processing packages, \nas well as all leading desktop publishing software, can be \nconverted to PDF (portable document format) files. The \nviewed version is identical on any platform and prints \nreliably on all printers, including offset press when properly \npackaged. PDF files also help reduce file size while maintaining \nthe integrity of your proposal layout. Above all, follow the \ncustomer's instructions. If they request a document type other \nthan PDF, provide that type. \n3\t\nUSE FORCED PAGE BREAKS TO CONTROL PAGINATION.\nFollowing this guideline will help evaluators see the material \nas you intended. However, no solution is foolproof.\nPages viewed on-screen may look different on different \nscreens, depending on the screen size and display settings. \nEven with identical computer hardware and software, printers \nwith different drivers or fonts might make a page print and/\nor display differently. Using page or section breaks helps \ntroubleshoot potential issues.\n4\t\nUSE GRAPHIC FILES THAT OFFER ADEQUATE RESOLUTION  \nFOR PRINTING OR VIEWING.\nSubmit graphic files that require as little memory as possible \nwithout producing a grainy or pixelated appearance. Smaller \nfiles load and print faster. Unless producing the proposal for \noffset printing, 150 dpi (dots per inch) is generally adequate \nfor most laser or inkjet printers. For online viewing, a 72 dpi \nresolution is adequate. \nGraphics programs offer multiple formats when saving files. \nConsider how the graphic will be used, whether printed, \nviewed on-screen, or inserted in a presentation. If you \nanticipate future edits, save the graphic in the native file \ncreation format, and save in a more compact format that is \ncompatible with your anticipated use and software.\nThe optimal file format also depends upon the type of graphic, \nwhether photograph or solid-color line art. Common graphics \nfile formats, definitions, and features are summarized in figure 1.\nFORMAT\nDEFINITION\nFEATURES\nTIF\nOr TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)\nStandard for printing but not for web browsers\nGIF\nGraphics Interchange Format\nLimited to 256 colors\nJPG\nOr JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)\nSmallest, loses detail when edited and saved; standard for web browsers\nPNG\nPortable Network Graphics\nSupports 16 million colors\nFigure 1. File Formats and Features. While the software evolves rapidly, these are the most frequently encountered graphics file formats in \nelectronic and printed proposals.\nSee \nPRODUCTION. \n\nElectronic Submittal\nShipley Proposal Guide\n85\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nLEARN AND TEST ALL ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS EARLY IN THE  \nPREPARATION PROCESS.\nAlways test production systems, including the electronic ones, \nto be sure there will be no problems. \nFor online procurement systems, learn and test the access, \nlayout, instructions, and outputs. These submittal systems \noften impose character limits or may contain restrictions on \nallowable file types or sizes. This information is good to know \nearly so that you don’t have to spend a lot of time reducing \ncharacter counts or other time-consuming rework. \nIf there are challenges with the procurement or sourcing site, \ncontact the customer to get clarification. If the procurement \nsystem is provided by a third-party vendor, you may be \ndirected to ask the vendor for technical support.\nWhen required to upload your submittal through a \nprocurement or sourcing portal, do not wait until the last \nminute. Give yourself a minimum of two hours or, optimally, \nsubmit the day before to ensure you have enough time and \nminimize technical issues.\nTest and check flash drives and other recording devices, \nprinting devices, and submittal systems early so you are aware \nof submittal speed and resulting confirmation of delivery.\n6\t\nUSE CONSISTENCY IN FILE NAMING TO HELP ORGANIZE YOUR SUBMITTAL.\nJust as you would with a hard copy submittal, ensure the \nquality of your proposal is consistent and your document \nstructure is well-organized. Employ a consistent file naming \nconvention to keep file names short and simple. Abbreviations \nin file names should be short and easily recognizable.  \nWhen including numerals for document ordering, employ a  \ntwo-digit format. \nAvoid the use of special characters, as these can cause \nproblems when uploading to a procurement or sourcing site, \nor for opening the document in certain programs. Well-named \nfiles will help with file order and enable your evaluator to see \nat a glance that you provided all required documentation. This \nwill also help with version control during the draft and review \nphases of proposal creation.\n7\t\nCONSIDER A LANDSCAPE, PDF FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS THAT WILL BE  \nREVIEWED ON-SCREEN.\nThe best page design for A4 (a metric standard of 210mm x \n297mm, or 8.268\" x 11.693\") or 8.5\" x 11\" paper may not be \nthe best design for a computer screen. For support, consider \nthe evolution of web pages. Early web pages often were taken \ndirectly from paper documents with little modification and \nwere ineffective. \nProposal page designs tend to be portrait, meaning a larger \nheight than width. Computer screens tend to be widescreen \n(i.e., have a larger width than height). Consider going to a \ntwo- or three-column landscape format to make your proposal \neasier to read on-screen. Use PDF format to ensure the \nviewer sees the content exactly as you intended, regardless of \ncomputer platform.\nAnother option is to send a hyperlinked file, but only if you \nhave the necessary tools and skills and if allowed by the \ncustomer. A hyperlinked file contains embedded links to \nmicrosites or additional files or \nscreens that may contain graphics, \nsupporting data, more detailed \nexplanations, and full-motion video \nwith sound. \nKeep the following in mind when \npreparing electronic submittals:\n•\t Be specific in your requests \nto customers to avoid being \nsurprised by their answers.\n•\t Always collaborate with the customer to understand what \nwill work best for both of your organizations.\n•\t Explicitly follow each customer’s final instructions. \nSurprises are almost always negative. The best time for \nconstructive collaboration is early in the sales cycle.\nSome evaluators also \nevaluate on-screen. \nWith a single monitor, \non-screen evaluators may \nprefer a narrower portrait \npresentation. Alternatively, \nthey may use an additional \nmonitor or may place the \nevaluation window above \nor below the proposal \nwindow. If so, the wider \npage would be preferred.\n\nExecutive Summary\nShipley Proposal Guide\n86\n©Shipley Associates\nThe draft executive summary should \nbe developed early during capture/\nopportunity planning. The capture/\nopportunity manager should prepare \nthe first draft and present it to management to demonstrate \nunderstanding of the customer’s hot button issues, vision, and \nthe seller’s baseline solution. \nThe initial draft is often only an outline with placeholders for \nthe seller’s solution. While the capture/opportunity manager \noften maintains executive summary ownership, the proposal \nmanager often transforms the outline, mockup, or first draft \ninto a draft acceptable for the proposal kickoff. \nReaders of your executive summary must clearly understand \nyour solution and its unique benefits and be able to justify \nrecommending your solution over competing solutions. \nEffective executive summaries meet the following criteria:\n•\t Connect your solution to the customer’s buying vision\n•\t Identify the customer’s needs and make ownership of \nthose needs explicit\n•\t Connect your solution directly to the customer’s needs\n•\t Offer clear proof of your claims\n•\t Show how you offer greater value than the competition\n•\t Be brief but comprehensive by eliminating confusing \ntechnical details that are better explained in the body of \nthe proposal\n•\t Indicate the next step, usually by previewing how your \nproposal is organized\nExecutive summaries are also powerful internal \ncommunication tools:\n•\t Help refine your bidding \nstrategy\n•\t Become a vehicle to gain \nsenior management \nendorsement\n•\t Communicate your \nstrategy in-house to all \ncontributors\n•\t Drive proposal development\n•\t Become a model for the complete proposal\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nExecutive summaries are often the most important pages in a proposal. They set the tone for individual evaluators and are often \nthe only pages read by the decision makers.\nThree executive \nsummaries are \nincluded in MODEL \nDOCUMENTS.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAlways include an executive summary.\nMaintain a customer focus throughout.\nBuild on your existing sales \nprocess and strategy.\n1\n2\n3\nExpand the Executive Summary Organizer into a \nsingle- or multiple-page draft.\nDevelop your executive summary based on \nproven best practices.\nFollow sound writing guidelines.\n5\n6\n7\nOrganize the content to be clear and persuasive \nusing the Executive Summary Organizer.\n4\nFollow a defined process when \npreparing on short notice.\n8\nBecause the executive summary \nis owned by the capture/\nopportunity manager but \noften written by the proposal \nmanager, this topic section is \nalso included in the Capture \nGuide.\n\nExecutive Summary\nShipley Proposal Guide\n87\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nMAINTAIN A CUSTOMER FOCUS THROUGHOUT.\nCheck the focus of your executive summaries against the \nfollowing criteria:\n•\t States the customer’s vision\n•\t Connects the vision to the immediate purchase\n•\t Cites the customer’s hot buttons in order of importance  \nor the order listed in the bid request\n•\t Makes the customer’s ownership of the hot buttons explicit\n•\t Addresses each hot button in the order introduced\n•\t Names the customer more than the seller\n•\t Names the customer before the seller in \nthe document, paragraphs, and sentences\n•\t Cites benefits before features\nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS.\n1\t\nALWAYS INCLUDE AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.\nIf the customer asks for an executive summary, submit one. If \nnot, do so anyway.\nCall it whatever the customer calls it. Common alternatives are \nmanagement summary and management overview.\nIndependent of what the customer calls it, understand \nthe difference between a summary and an introduction. A \nsummary summarizes the essential content of your proposal. \nAn introduction indicates how your proposal is organized. \nOther terms for introduction are preview, road map, and \ninformal table of contents.\nTo include an executive summary when the proposal outline is \nstrictly defined in the bid request, you have several compliant \nalternatives. One is to include a separately bound executive \nsummary. Place a copy in every volume submitted, either \nin a pocket in the front or in the binder. \nNote that in page-limited proposals, \nthe executive summary is considered part of your technical \nproposal.\nAn alternative is to make the executive summary the first part \nof your volume summary in each volume of the proposal.\nSummarize at all levels: proposal, volume, section, and \nquestion.\nSee ORGANIZATION.\n3\t\nBUILD ON YOUR EXISTING SALES PROCESS AND STRATEGY.\nTo maintain a consistent message with your customer and to \nsave time, exploit your existing internal information sources as \nmuch as possible. \nMany organizations have embraced a strategic and/or tactical \nsales process. Exploit it to develop your executive summary \nrather than starting over. With a little effort, you can map the \ninformation from existing sales templates into your executive \nsummary.\nWhen business development people are asked to draft the \nexecutive summary, too many still pull the last one they \nprepared, do a search and replace for customer and product \nnames, add one or two sentences, and submit. They continue \nto tailor their last executive summary for subsequent \nopportunities until the executive summary completely \nunravels.\nMost of the information needed to prepare the executive \nsummary is contained in the capture plan and proposal \nmanagement plan. The three key worksheets, the Executive \nSummary Planning Worksheet, Strategy Statement \nWorksheet, summarized in figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively, are \nrecommended to help assemble and organize the information \nneeded for an executive summary. One example issue is \ncompleted to illustrate each worksheet.\nThe most frequently overlooked portion of strategy statements \nis how the strategy will be implemented. Note the how in the \nfollowing example:\nWe will emphasize our ability to test full-scale components by includ-\ning a photo of our Manchester test facility.\nUsing the information in the three \nworksheets, prepare the Executive Summary \nPlanning Worksheet shown in figure 4 with \nthe same hot buttons/issues consolidated \nfrom the other three worksheets.\nYou now have the information needed to begin drafting your \nexecutive summary.\nSee CAPTURE/\nOPPORTUNITY \nPLANNING and \nPROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT \nPLAN.\n\nExecutive Summary\nShipley Proposal Guide\n88\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 1.

The mirror \napproach is a miniature version of your proposal, most often \nused when the proposal is formally solicited, and the structure \nis rigidly defined in the bid request.\nThe Executive Summary Organizer includes four primary \nboxes, organized around your customer’s hot button issues:\nBox 1\nSummary: Align with the customer’s vision, summarize needs, preview \nyour solution, and indicate compliance.\nBox 2\nIntroduction: Introduce the customer’s hot buttons.\nBox 3\nBody: Present your solution aligned with \nthe customer’s hot buttons, including \nsubstantiating detail as proof of your \nclaims.\nBox 4\nReview: Much like Box 1, summarize the needs and your solution, and \nstate the next step.\nUse the Executive Summary Organizer to draft an executive \nsummary in an organized, expandable structure. Also, use it to \nprepare other sales documents and presentations. \nIf you have developed a quantified value proposition, consider \norganizing your executive summary around components of \nthe value proposition rather than hot button issues. State your \nquantified value proposition as the theme statement in Box \n1. Introduce quantified components \nin Box 2, and then expand on each \ncomponent in Box 3.

For example (features \nunderlined):\nThe controller has 400MB of memory.\nThis model offers rack-and-pinion steering, 110 horsepower, and a \n7-year/70,000-mile warranty.\nAdvantages are how, in the seller’s opinion, the product or \nservice can help the customer.\nNotice how the features link to advantages in the following \nexamples (advantages underlined):\nThe controller’s 400MB of memory allows you to store more  \ninstructions than your current model.\nThe rack-and-pinion steering provides a fast, accurate steering \nresponse.\nAdvantages are more powerful than features, and are, \npotential benefits.\nBenefits are advantages that can solve a problem for the \ncustomer. They address the specific issues for which the \ncustomer is seeking a solution. Advantages become benefits \nonly under two conditions:\n1.\t They are linked to the customer’s needs (issues).\n2.\t The customer wants them.\nCustomer issues are the perceived impediments to \nsuccessfully achieving an objective and are also referred to \nas worries, hurts, or pains. Benefits help the customer past \nthese impediments to success. In this way, benefits become \nthe converse of issues: if an issue represents a cost or pain, the \nbenefit eliminates the cost and relieves the pain.\nGeneric examples of benefits that alleviate issues include \nreduced cost or risk and improved quality, reliability, profit, or \nsafety. \nOur CNC controller with 780MB of \nmemory can meet your need to \nelectronically download larger CAD \ninstructions.\nYour interest in avoiding Manhat-\ntan’s numerous road hazards is \npossible when you specify accurate, \nresponsive, rack and pinion steering.\nAs selling points, features \nhave the least impact on \ndecision makers and can lead \nto price concerns if overused. \nAdvantages are stronger than \nfeatures. Convert advantages to \nbenefits as the sale advances to \nminimize objections, especially \nin complex sales. Helping the \ncustomer see value is especially \nuseful when the customer \ndoes not initially value the \nadvantages, or even views them \nas negatives.  \nCollaborate with the customer to understand the customer’s \nissues, concerns, and preferences. Collaboration builds \nrapport and educates both customers and sellers. Explicitly \nlink your features to advantages and convert advantages to \nbenefits. All are important. Customers \nmust explicitly acknowledge or confirm \nthe value of a feature to convert its \nadvantage into a benefit.\nBenefits have the strongest and most lasting impact on the \ncustomer’s decisions because they are explicitly linked to \nalleviating issues. In short, customers buy benefits. \nSome sales systems stress \nfeatures, advantages, and \nbenefits while others dismiss \nthem as obsolete. These \ndifferent views about the \nimportance of features, ad-\nvantages, and benefits are \nmostly semantic, resulting \nfrom proponents trying to \ndiscriminate their sales \nsystems. \nDifferentiators are features \nof your offering that differ \nfrom a competitor’s offer-\ning—often called a “unique \nselling point.” \nDiscriminators are fea-\ntures of your offer that (1) \ndiffer from a competitor’s \noffer (differentiator) and \n(2) are acknowledged by the    \ncustomer as important.\nFeatures, advantages, and benefits are needed to sell effectively in person and in a proposal. Sales and proposal \nprofessionals with extensive training about features, advantages, and benefits often omit benefits, fail to link features to \nbenefits, or mention benefits only at the end of a presentation or proposal section.\nSee DISCRIMINATORS.\n\nFeatures, Advantages, and Benefits\nShipley Proposal Guide\n94\n©Shipley Associates\nFEATURES, ADVANTAGES, AND BENEFITS\nCollaborate with the customer to develop a common \nvision of the customer’s issues and needs.\nMembers of the selling team must have a common \nunderstanding of the customer’s issues and needs before \nthey discuss the features and benefits of their solution.\nConvert advantages to benefits.\n1\n2\n3\nEmphasize benefits over features.\nQuantify benefits whenever possible.\n4\n5\n1\t\nCOLLABORATE WITH THE CUSTOMER TO DEVELOP A COMMON VISION OF THE \nCUSTOMER’S ISSUES AND NEEDS.\nBenefits cannot be accurately addressed \nuntil the customer and the seller develop \na common vision of the customer’s \nissues and needs and of an acceptable \nsolution. Experienced sellers routinely \nmake educated guesses about what a \ncustomer needs. These guesses can be wrong if the customer’s \nneeds are latent or if this customer’s needs are different from \nprevious customers’ needs.\nConsider the following statement to an auto buyer:\nThis auto’s 4-cylinder engine, rated at 56 miles per gallon, will give \nyou an economical way to commute.\nMost proposal writers would cite the 4-cylinder engine as the \nfeature and economical way to commute as the benefit. The \neconomical way to commute is a benefit if the customer is \npurchasing the auto to commute. If the customer is interested \nin racing the auto, this feature is a negative benefit. If the \ncustomer is unconcerned about fuel economy, the feature \nis merely an advantage. If the customer is reimbursed for \noperating expenses, the economical operation is neither \npositive nor negative.\nSellers that claim to know the benefits of their offerings before \ncollaborating with the customer are guessing. When the \ncustomer and seller have a common vision of the solution, the \nseller can accurately address customer benefits.\nFeatures linked to \nbenefits become \nyour potential  \ndiscriminators.\n2\t\nMEMBERS OF THE SELLING TEAM MUST HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF \nTHE CUSTOMER’S ISSUES AND NEEDS BEFORE THEY DISCUSS THE FEATURES \nAND BENEFITS OF THEIR SOLUTION.\nMany sales professionals and their sales support staff \nmisunderstand and misuse features, advantages, and benefits \nin their sales documents. Consider your proposals:\n1.\t Are they feature rich and benefit poor? Customers \nbuy benefits. They remember benefits well after most \nfeatures are forgotten.\n2.\t Do they lead with features and close with benefits? \nReaders often stop reading before they get to the \nbenefits.\n3.\t Are features linked to benefits? Customers with less \nexpertise than the seller need to see the direct link \nbetween the feature and benefit to value the feature.\n4.\t Are the benefits cited generic and only mildly appealing? \nDid this customer indicate a need or desire for these \nbenefits?\nFrequently, sales people accurately identify the benefits but \nfail to communicate them to their proposal writers. With no \ndirect knowledge of the customer’s issues and needs, writers \nguess about benefits or ignore benefits. Alternatively, writers \nSee DISCRIMINATORS.\n\nFeatures, Advantages, and Benefits\nShipley Proposal Guide\n95\n©Shipley Associates\ndiscuss what they know best, the features of their products \nand services. Writers with short deadlines often use previously \nwritten material and ignore benefits because it saves time. \nConsider this example:\nA seller touts a hair restoration product (feature) that promises to \ncreate “great hair” (advantage) and suggests an improved social \nlife (benefit). The customer is a confident, happily married man with \ngreat hair.\nThis seller fails because (1) the customer \nalready believes he has “great hair” and \n(2) the customer does not require “great \nhair” to improve his social life.\nSales systems that dismiss \nthe importance of features \nand benefits are dis-\nmissing generic benefits. \nGeneric benefits are often \nadvantages at best and \nnegative at worst. To \nunderstand this nuance, \nreview the dialog in a com-\nmercial or the captions in \nan advertisement. Note \nthe “benefits” that do not \ninterest you. \n3\t\nCONVERT ADVANTAGES TO BENEFITS.\nAdvantages are valuable early in a sale because customers \nwill accept intelligent assumptions made by the seller. As \nthe sale advances, the seller is expected to listen carefully \nand develop competence about specific customer needs. \nContinued reliance on early assumptions indicates a lack of \nseller competence, i.e., “This seller does not understand what \nI need.”\nThe discipline of creating capture plans, sales plans, proposal \nplans, early executive summary drafts, strategy white papers, \ntheme statements, and action captions encourages the sales \nteam to do three things:\n•\t Identify issues.\n•\t Convert advantages to benefits.\n•\t Connect benefits to a specific feature of its offer.\nOrganizations that rely extensively on previously written \nmaterial usually submit ineffective proposals. Such proposals \nare full of features and advantages. Too few advantages are \naccepted as benefits by the customer.\nTo review how features \nand benefits are incorpo-\nrated into sales planning \ndocuments and proposals, \nsee ACTION CAPTIONS, \nCAPTURE/OPPORTUNITY \nPLANNING, PROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT PLAN, \nPROPOSAL STRATEGY, \nand THEME STATEMENTS.\n4\t\nEMPHASIZE BENEFITS OVER FEATURES.\nHigh value sales are characterized by multiple buyers, multiple \nsellers, and long sales cycles. Lower value sales have a single \nbuyer and seller and a short sales cycle.\nIn high value sales, buyers purchase benefits, not features. For \nexample:\nA major organization is purchasing a $5 million computer numerically \ncontrolled machine tool. A detailed analysis of the cost and benefits \nof available tools and options with each tool is made to determine the \nbottom-line impact. No one selects machine tools because “We liked \nthe color.”\nFeatures can positively impact low value sales. Personal \nexamples of a low value sale might be a cell phone, TV, or hand \ntool. Buyers of these items justify their purchase with reasons \nlike the following: \n•\t It looked good.\n•\t I liked the color.\n•\t It fit the available space.\n•\t It had more features than the other model.\nFeatures place emphasis on the seller and the seller’s products \nand services. However, customers care about themselves and \ntheir organizations. They want to know whether the benefits \ngenerated by specific features of the seller’s solution will \naddress their issues and deliver the benefits they seek. \n\nFeatures, Advantages, and Benefits\nShipley Proposal Guide\n96\n©Shipley Associates\nCustomers faced with mind-numbing lists of features that are \nnot linked to benefits resort to looking for the lowest price.\nThe following example, common to many computer users and \nweb surfers, illustrates what often happens when features are \nnot linked to benefits. All three experts assure the customer \nthat their recommended solution will save them time. \nWe all hate to wait for our computer to complete a task. We feel the “pain” of wasted time, our issue. \nWe talked to three experts who recommend three different solutions:\nEXPERT\nFEATURE\nADVANTAGE\n1\nUpgrade 2.0GHz processor to 4.0GHz\n2x increase in processor speed\n2\nUpgrade memory from 2GB to 32GB\n16x increase in memory\n3\nUpgrade WiFi connection to  \nFiber Optic Network\n10x increase in data transfer speed\nE X A M P L E\nThe customer is confused by the diverse recommendations, \nuncertain whether any of the recommendations will solve \ntheir problem, so they don’t buy. The customer fails to see a \nvalid link between the feature, the claimed advantage, and the \nbenefit they seek.\nIn this example, the customer’s issue is clear—wasted time. \nThe cause, however, is not clear. When the cause is clear to the \ncustomer, the customer can approve the solution.\n5\t\nQUANTIFY BENEFITS WHENEVER POSSIBLE.\nThe potential value of benefits ranges from tangible and \nquantifiable to intangible and perhaps non-quantifiable. \nPotential customers determine value and will not become \ncustomers until the value of the benefits being purchased \nexceeds the price. \nMany organizations involved in  \ncomplex sales routinely train their \nsales teams to develop value prop-\nositions for the reasons just listed. \nWhile sales teams struggle to identify \nand quantify benefits, the process is \nbeneficial. Collaboration is im-\nproved, their solutions are improved, \nand the purchase decisions are \nusually easier and quicker. \nSee VALUE PROPOSITIONS,  \nCapture Guide.\nQuantifying benefits helps the seller in at least three ways:\nForces collaboration: Because only customers can \ndetermine value, the customer and seller must \ncollaborate to determine the value of a solution. After \nthe customer has helped determine the value, the \nsolution seems more acceptable.\nSharpens vision: Quantifying benefits improves the \nsolution. The least beneficial features are dropped \nand more beneficial features might be added. Both \nthe customer and the seller gain a clearer vision of \nthe solution.\n1\n2\n3\nBetter justifies a price that is already quantified: \nCustomers often make a value judgment that \nthe solution is worth the price. However, as sales \nbecome more complex, customers increasingly need \nquantitative support for their value judgment. Group \npurchase decisions are easier when the benefits \nclearly exceed the price.\n\nGobbledygook\nShipley Proposal Guide\n97\n©Shipley Associates\nGOBBLEDYGOOK\nGobbledygook is the result of using abstract or pompous \nwords and long, convoluted sentences. The meaning is  \noften unintelligible.

Are you selling a \nweapon system, an airplane, or an F-22?\nWhen you plan to “interface” with the customers, do you plan \nto call, write, meet, teleconference, or send an email?\nMany writers are vague because they either do not know \nhow to be specific or they want to avoid being wrong. While \nunderstandable, readers may sense the writer is being evasive \nand cannot be trusted.\nProposal writers often avoid being specific to reduce the risk to \ntheir organization. For example, if you say that you will report \nregularly, then you cannot be challenged or sued if you report \ndaily, weekly, monthly, or annually. If you say that you will \nreduce the customer’s costs, then you cannot be challenged by \nyour contracts department or by the customer for insufficient \ncost reductions. \nGeneralized claims often suggest that you either do not \nunderstand the situation or are intentionally evasive. Neither is \nlikely to convince the customer to select your offer.\nSellers must balance their desire to reduce their risk against \nthe probability of winning the bid.\nFigure 1 lists pompous words and simple alternatives.\n\nGobbledygook\nShipley Proposal Guide\n98\n©Shipley Associates\nPOMPUS\nSIMPLE\nPOMPUS\nSIMPLE\nPOMPUS\nSIMPLE\nPOMPUS\nSIMPLE\nAccordingly\nadditional\nameliorate \nascertain \nacquire, purchase\nactivate\napprehend\napprise\napproximately \nassistance\nattempt\nCognizant\ncommence\ncompletion\nconfiguration\nso \nmore \nimprove\nlearn\nbuy\nstart \ncatch\ntell\nabout\nhelp\ntry\naware\nstart\nend\nshape, design\nDemonstrate\ndiscontinue\ndisseminate\nEmploy\nencounter\nevacuate\nexceedingly\nexhibit\nFabricate\nfunction\nHeterogeneous\nInterface with\ninform\nshow\nstop \ndistribute\nhire or use\nmeet \nleave, empty, clear \nvery\nshow\nmake\nwork, act\ndifferent\ncall, meet, discuss\ntell\nLocality\nleverage\nMagnitude\nmanifest\nmanufacture\nmethodology\nmodification\nNecessity\nnumerous\nParamount\nperspective\npossesses\nproceed\nplace \nuse\nsize\nshow\nmake\nmethod, process,  \napproach\nchange\nneed\nmany\nmain, chief\nview\nhas \ngo\nRamification\nremunerate\nrequest\nresidence\nScheme\nsophisticated\nstonewalling\nsubsequently\nTerminate\ntransmit\nUtilization\nutilize\nresult\npay\nask\nhome\nplan, idea, project \ncomplex \nlying \nlater\nend \nsend\nuse\nuse\nFigure 1.

Funders are \ngovernment agencies, foundations, corporations, or even \nprivate individuals. Most funders require a grant proposal that \ndescribes and justifies how the funds will be used.\nGrant proposals are as varied as the activities they support—\nfrom aiding children with birth defects, to funding scientific \nresearch, to beautifying playgrounds. Similarly, grant proposal \napplication requirements and evaluation processes vary.\nFunders require grant applications consisting of an application \nform, a proposal, or both. An application form is exactly \nthat—a form that asks for the applicant’s name, address, \nand other information, including the applicant’s reasons for \nrequesting the funding. Using application forms simplifies \nevaluation, fosters the appearance of fairness, and may reduce \napplication time. \nA grant proposal, as discussed in this Proposal Guide, is usually \nan original document with a logical structure and a clear \nargument for funding. For some grants, a full grant application \nrequires both a completed form and a written grant proposal. \nGrant proposals share common elements with proposals \nfor professional services, such as architectural, engineering, \nand research and development (R&D). Both have numerous \ncompetitors, and the evaluations often incorporate peer \nreviews. \nMost professional services proposal guidelines apply to grant \nproposals. Both respond to well-defined \ncriteria but operate under a similar “no single \nright answer” concept.\nGrant writing is a branch of proposal writing practiced largely by non-profit organizations seeking funds to maintain or \nexpand their services. Grant writers can win more funding by following sales proposal guidelines and best practices.\nSuperior grant \napplications are \npersuasive sales \ndocuments.\n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n100\n©Shipley Associates\nGRANT WRITING\nVerify your eligibility.\nIdentify and address the funder’s \nexplicit, implicit, and hidden issues.\nConsider how your proposal will be evaluated.\n1\n2\n3\nDescribe the acute needs of your target population \nvividly and precisely. Use emotional appeal backed \nby the most credible facts available.\nAddress the program’s goals in every section.\nDirectly link project objectives, activities, \nmilestones, and costs.\n8\n9\n10\nCarefully follow all submittal instructions.\n4\nLink all expenses to required activities and \nemphasize added value.\n11\nFollow sound document  \norganization principles.\nLead with a short, compelling \nexecutive summary.\nState your goals as an attractive, positive \nvision, linked to quantitative objectives.\n5\n6\n7\nSupport all claims.\nLimit appendices to requested material.\nUse emphasis devices to engage reviewers, simplify \nreview, shorten the proposal, and raise your score.\n12\n13\n14\n1\t\nVERIFY YOUR ELIGIBILITY. \nEligibility rules are complex, so verify \nyour eligibility. Eligibility applies at \nseveral levels: \n•\t Minimum standards to apply for the grant\n•\t Preferences or extra points given to bidders with desired \ncharacteristics\n•\t Acceptable service approaches\nFor example, government funders \nmay set cost-effectiveness criteria. \nPrograms exceeding the cost-per-\nparticipant criteria are ineligible. \nAll funders have award guidelines \nand funding priorities. Save time by scanning funders’ profiles \nin the award guidelines for the following items:\n•\t Limitations describe locations, applicants, or activities \nthey will not fund.\n•\t Purpose and activities should reflect your  \norganization’s values.\n•\t Fields of interest should fit your program activities  \nand target population. Funders might not use your terms \nor jargon.\n•\t Types of support must match how you plan to use the \nfunds. Funders may direct, limit, or exclude support for \ncapital investments, overhead, operating activities, travel, \npaid staff, or consultants.\n•\t Previous grants or grantees may be excluded. \nConversely, funders might prefer to focus funding in a \nspecific area or to direct funding to specific organizations.\n•\t Grant amounts may be limited due to budget constraints \nor the desire to fund multiple programs. Some funders \nwill not fund more than a set percentage of an applicant’s \ntotal budget. \nDetermine the types and sizes of grant awards made by non-\nprofits in the U.S. by reviewing their Internal Revenue Service \nwebsite. New applicants seldom get all the funds or even the \nlargest single award. Consider the likely number of rewards \nand request an “average” amount.\nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS.\nEveryone in your organi-\nzation must understand \neligibility guidelines and \nagree to comply with \nthose guidelines.\n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n101\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nIDENTIFY AND ADDRESS FUNDERS’ EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, AND HIDDEN ISSUES. \nIssues are funders’ concerns, not yours. Concerns that the \napplicant has about a solution or approach are called gaps—\nthe difference between what the funder wants and what the \napplicant can offer. Issues are owned by the funder, not the \napplicant. Avoid the confusion caused by mingling funder \nissues and applicant gaps. \nAll proposals should focus on funders’ issues. The goals, \nobjectives, proposed activities, experience, and performance \nof the applicant are relevant and interesting to evaluators \nonly if they are linked to funders’ issues. Your proposal is your \nopportunity to convince them that you are the best candidate \nto address their issues. \nThe first place to look for funders’ issues is in their stated \nfunding goals and objectives. Review funders’ other public \nmaterials. Discuss funders’ issues with individuals from their \norganizations, when possible, without being intrusive or \nviolating funders’ guidelines. \nYou will find three types of issues—explicit, implicit, and \nhidden. Explicit issues are stated and owned by funders. When \nrestating them, use the funders’ terms. Do not paraphrase or \nswitch to your own terms. \nImplicit issues are implied, may or may not be understood, \nand are often not readily apparent to everyone. When restating \nimplicit issues in your proposal, reword them to be explicit. \nHidden issues are either unknown or intentionally unstated. \nThe most dangerous hidden issues are “unmentionable.” For \nexample, public figures may be reluctant to discuss some \nissues for fear of alienating an important constituency. Address \nhidden issues positively or avoid them.\nSee PROPOSAL \nSTRATEGY.\n3\t\nCONSIDER HOW YOUR PROPOSAL WILL BE EVALUATED. \nWinning proposals are consistently easy to evaluate at every \nstep of the evaluation process and, as a result, receive higher \nscores. Typical evaluation steps are:\n•\t Initial screening\n•\t Independent, individual review and scoring\n•\t Identification and resolution of scoring anomalies\n•\t Recommendations and approval for funding\n•\t Permission to proceed and disbursement of funds\nThe initial screening eliminates proposals that do not meet the \nmost basic submissions criteria:\n•\t Are all forms included?\n•\t Are all forms completed and signed?\n•\t Are page limitations and format guidelines met?\n•\t Are requested funding levels acceptable?\n•\t Are all eligibility guidelines met?\n•\t Are all required dates met (submittal, commencement, \nconclusion, reporting)?\nWhen faced with hundreds of proposals, the incentive is high \nfor screeners to quickly eliminate unqualified entries.\nInitial screening also eliminates the entries that may not \ncomply with legal requirements. Government funders must \nfollow the law, or their decisions can be challenged. Non-\ngovernment funders have more latitude, but they generally \nstay within the organizations’ \nguidelines. Comply with all \nsubmission criteria to avoid initial \nrejection. \nIf your proposal passes the initial \nscreening, it moves to independent, \nindividual review and scoring. This detailed review compares \nproposal content with funding agency criteria.\nSeveral experts may independently evaluate your proposal. \nTheir evaluations will be based on how well you meet the \nestablished funding criteria. Reviewers score the proposal or \nassigned sections and provide comments justifying their score. \nIf scoring anomalies occur, reviewers typically identify and \nresolve them. Reviewers are asked to discuss and defend \ntheir scores when high and low scores vary more than a \npredetermined amount. \nAfter scores are tallied and differences resolved, \nrecommendations and approval for funding follow.\nInfluence reviewer \nselection when possible. \nRecommend peer review-\ners, when permitted, but \nbe aware of potential \nconflicts of interest.\n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n102\n©Shipley Associates\nHowever, even if you receive a \nrecommendation for funding, do not \nassume you can proceed. Sufficient \nfunds may not be available, or other \nsituations may arise to prevent funding. \nWhen all conditions are met and you know funds are or will be \ndisbursed, then proceed.\nEvaluation processes range from formal to informal. Generally, \nthe more detailed or formal the evaluation process, the \nlarger the proposal will need to be. Guidelines for different \nevaluation processes are included below:\n•\t Governments tend to use more formal evaluation \nprocedures and request larger proposals.\n•\t Corporations and private individuals tend to want \nproposals less than five pages long and have a less formal \nevaluation process. Engage them on the first page or risk \nrejection.\n•\t Foundations have varying processes. Determine if they \nprefer a formal or informal process and submit a proposal \nto match that preference.\nNot all grants are  \nnumerically scored. \nOther grading systems \nmight be used.\n4\t\nCAREFULLY FOLLOW ALL SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS. \nTo get the highest possible score, read the grant proposal \nsubmittal instructions carefully and follow \nthem exactly, even if they are illogical. \nProposal reviewers will expect to find your \nresponses in the specified order. Any deviation from the order \nof instructions makes the reviewers’ tasks more difficult \nand suggests that you might not follow through on grant \nrequirements. The result would likely be a lower score.\nWhen instructions are not clear, explain your approach in a \npositive, customer-focused manner.\nPoor explanation\nWhile you did not specifically request the background and history of \nour organization, we have included it in the “Overview” section to \ndemonstrate our long commitment to improving the reading skills of \nelementary school students. \nBetter, customer-focused explanation\nTo simplify your evaluation, we have summarized our prior elementa-\nry school reading enhancement activities in a short sidebar. All sub-\nsection topics are discussed in the order requested in your submittal \nguidelines. \nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS and \nOUTLINING.\n5\t\n FOLLOW SOUND DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES. \nWhile the principles of organization vary slightly from \ndocument to document, organizational guidelines for grant \nproposals and sales proposals are similar. \n1.\tCarefully follow all submittal instructions. \n2.\tOrganize information to simplify evaluation. Use \ngraphics, tables, informative headings, and callouts to \nhelp reviewers find information and relate it to their \nneeds.\n3.\tGroup similar ideas. A scattered, disorganized response \nsuggests you cannot organize and manage proposed \nactivities. \nThe required contents for grant proposals \nvary by government agency and \nfoundation. Figure 1 summarizes and contrasts the contents \nfor both.\nState your most important points first. Place remaining \npoints in decreasing order of importance to the reader. If \nreviewers cannot find answers they need right away or if they \nlose interest, they will stop reading.\nSummarize at all levels. Begin each section with an \nintroductory summary. If reviewers quit reading after the first \nsentence of each section, would they get your key point for \nthat section? Preview supporting points in the same order \nyou will present it. If reviewers quit reading after the first \nparagraph, would they understand your message? Will they be \nable to find the points in your text that were previewed in your \nintroduction?\nAfter the introduction, include material that supports your \npoint and presents your message. Follow the point order you \npresented in the introduction. Close with a section summary. \nReviewers hear your message three times: in the introductory \nsummary, in the supporting material, and in the closing \nsummary. If your proposal is very short, you may only need a \nbrief introduction and closing.\nSee CHOOSING \nCORRECT WORDS.\n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n103\n©Shipley Associates\nAdjust your writing style to the reviewers. Use the correct \nterms, but do not overuse jargon and acronyms. While \nreviewers may be familiar with certain jargon and acronyms, \nthese terms are dull and have less emotional appeal. \nRemember that persuasion requires both emotion and logic. \nToo many grant writers mistakenly assume that reviewers have \nsimilar backgrounds and embrace jargon, big sentences, and \nbig words.\nG O V E R N M E N T  A G E N C Y\nF O U N D A T I O N\n1.\t Application cover form\n2.\tExecutive summary or \nabstract\n3.\tTable of contents\n4.\tProgram narrative\n5.\tBudget\n6.\tCertifications, forms\n7.\t Attachments\n1.\t Cover letter  \n(Introduction, purpose, \namount requested, closing)\n2.\tCover sheet  \n(Requesting organization, \nkey contact, mission \nstatement, finances, \nsummary of grant request)\n3.\tNarrative  \n(Executive summary, \ndescription of the program \nand proposed impacts)\n4.\tAttachments  \n(Limited to requested items)\nFigure 1.

For example, target 30 pages for government agencies, 7 to 10 for foundations, and 3 to 5 for corporations, \nexcluding required attachments. \n6\t\nLEAD WITH A SHORT, COMPELLING EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. \nThe executive summary is the most important page in a grant \nproposal. It provides a brief, but comprehensive, guide for \nindividual reviewers and is often the only section the decision \nmaker will read.\nThe executive summary is a synopsis of the entire proposal \ncontent, not an ordering of information as in an introduction. \nExecutive summaries for grants are often called abstracts or \npreviews. Name it using the funder’s terminology. If the funder \ndoes not ask for an executive summary, provide a 1-page \nsummary anyway.\nGrant summaries should meet the following criteria, not \nnecessarily in this order:\n•\t Identify the funder’s needs in explicit terms, using the \nfunder’s terminology.\n•\t Identify the funder’s goals and objectives, again using the \nfunder’s terminology.\n•\t State your solutions, and connect them directly to the \nfunder’s needs.\n•\t State your goals and measurable objectives, and connect \nthem to the funder’s goals and objectives.\n•\t Summarize how your solution positively sets you apart \nfrom your competition.\n•\t Summarize the beneficial impact (benefit), cost, timing, \nand funding amount requested.\n•\t Incorporate visual and emotional support of your claims, \nwhere possible.\n•\t Maintain a customer focus throughout.\n•\t Use sound writing guidelines.\nSee EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, \nGRAPHICS, SERVICE  \nPROPOSALS, and THEME \nSTATEMENTS. \n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n104\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nSTATE YOUR GOALS AS AN ATTRACTIVE, POSITIVE VISION, LINKED TO  \nQUANTITATIVE OBJECTIVES. \nGoals are rooted in the vision of what you will attain when the \ngrant is completed and are not measurable or timed. Funders \nalso have goals. To win, you must connect your goals to the \nfunders’ goals. \nObjectives are measurable, timed milestones. Each goal \nhas a supporting series of measurable objectives or \nbenchmarks that lead to the goal. The objectives in the grant \nannouncement must be the objectives for your program. \nAddress every objective in your needs \nor problem statement, and link every \nactivity to an objective. \nDraft either outcome or process \nobjectives. Outcome objectives \nare stronger and more convincing because they imply a \nmeasurable improvement. Outcome objectives tend to begin \nwith words like expand, increase, reduce, or collect. \nProcess objectives are not quantifiable or measurable; they \nare either complete or not complete. Process objectives tend \nto begin with words like provide, establish, develop, initiate, \nor create and link project deliverables/\nactivities to outcome objectives. \nWrite process objectives only if required. Because funders \nwill look for measurable outcomes rather than activities for \ntheir funding, outcome objectives are more powerful and \npersuasive. \nState goals and objectives in a single sentence. If you  \ncannot, simplify. \nSuperior objectives incorporate three parts:\n1.\t What quantified change will occur?\n2.\t Who will be impacted?\n3.\t How will they be impacted? \nReview the following goal and sub-objectives:\nGood example\nGoal 1: Improve the reading skills of American children. \nOutcome objective 1a: Raise the reading ability of 25 grade 1-4 chil-\ndren in the Gallatin Valley by two grade levels. \nOutcome objective 1b: Dedicate 100 Pet Partner® hours per week to \npractice reading with individual, grade 1-4 children in the Gallatin \nValley at participating public libraries and elementary schools. \nNotice how the following process objective is weaker and less \npersuasive than outcome objective 1b. \nLess effective process objective\nProcess objective 1c: Provide the opportunity for grade 1-4 children \nin the Gallatin Valley to practice their reading skills by reading to \nPet Partner teams at participating public libraries and elementary \nschools. \nWhat if no children participate? How many libraries, \nschools, and children must participate for the program to be \nsuccessful?\nWhile the target group is clear, cite or identify the number of \nchildren, practice hours, and service locations. \nOutcome objectives are \nmore powerful, more \npersuasive, and ultimate-\nly more successful than \nprocess objectives.\nSee GUIDELINE 10. \n8\t\nDESCRIBE THE ACUTE NEEDS OF YOUR TARGET POPULATION VIVIDLY AND  \nPRECISELY. USE EMOTIONAL APPEAL BACKED BY THE MOST CREDIBLE  \nFACTS AVAILABLE. \nVividly emphasize the acute problem \nthat you will address if your grant is \nfunded. Funders want the greatest \nbenefit for the money spent. They also \nwant to fund where needs are greatest. \nAdopt a strategy that the needs you \naddress are dire and immediate and that their funding will \nrelieve the suffering. \nWrite about all aspects of the problem very specifically. If you \ncite facts and statistics, use the most credible sources. Most-to-\nleast credible types of statistical sources are:\n•\t What this potential funder says \n•\t What other, similar funders say\n•\t What truly independent sources say\n•\t What you say\nFederal grants must \ncontribute to the \nbenefit of the public as \na whole, not just the \nbenefit of an individual \npublic agency.\n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n105\n©Shipley Associates\nLess successful proposals tend to emphasize the last of these—\napplicants’ opinions about the needs, their services, and their \norganizations. All applicants stress their worthiness. Making \nidentical assertions will not discriminate your request.\nKeep all facts current, usually with nothing older than 5 years. \nDemonstrate your expertise but do not exaggerate. Precisely \naddress every program objective in the grant application, \ndescribing each service lacking in your area. \nAddressing the need as dire can be difficult when seeking a \nrenewal, extension, or supplementary funding. Funders might \nquestion your effectiveness. Instead, emphasize the need to \nexpand a proven but limited program. Show that the needs of \npeople outside your program are still dire, or explain that the \npeople being served have additional needs. \nPoor example\nNumerous politicians, educators, and media articles have bemoaned \nthe poor reading skills of young children. A significant minority that \nbegin their education with poor reading skills remain poor achievers \nin all areas. Those that begin behind stay behind. You can help Park \nCity elementary and preschool children succeed by supporting the \nR.E.A.D.® Program. \nBetter example\nIn our highest poverty schools, 68 percent of fourth graders could not \nread at the basic level, according to the U.S. Department of Educa-\ntion. Over the last 15 years, 15 million students have graduated from \nhigh school without the ability to read at the basic level. Former First \nLady Laura Bush noted in her Ready to Read/Ready to Learn initiative: \nWe know that children who have poor beginning reading skills are \nless likely to develop better reading skills throughout their school \ncareers. Children, who start school behind, often stay behind. We \ncan reverse that trend.\nYour own report, Park City Education Statistics for 20XX, cited 3000 \nstudents in this at-risk category. Your own statistics noted that \nR.E.A.D. participants improved their reading skills two to four grade \nlevels. At a cost of less than $200 per child, the Park City School Dis-\ntrict should not only renew the R.E.A.D. Program, but also support its \nexpansion to serve 500 at-risk children.\nNote how the poor example was based on the applicant’s \nopinion and lacked statistics. In contrast, the better example \ncited facts from the U.S. Department of Education, the \nformer First Lady, and the potential \nfunder’s own study. Also note that the \ndire continuing need focuses on the \npopulation not yet being served. \nClearly differentiate  \npublic needs, the \nfunder’s needs, your  \ntarget population’s \nneeds, and your own \nneeds for funding.\n9\t\nADDRESS THE PROGRAM’S GOALS IN EVERY SECTION. \nThe typical contents of a grant were listed in guideline 5. \nAddress the program’s goals in every section. Remember that \nthe funder’s goals in the grant application are your goals for \nthis program. \nMuch like drafting customer-focused theme statements, begin \nthe first sentence of each section by restating a funder’s goal \nlinked to the topic that you are discussing. Consider these \nexamples: \nExecutive Summary Theme Statement\nYour goal of reducing the auto traffic congestion in the Gotham City \ncentral business district by 10 percent can be met by funding the \nLoaner Bike Program at $5,000 per month. \nProgram Narrative Theme Statement\nGotham City’s 10 percent auto traffic reduction goal can be met if 15 \npercent of the sub-one mile trips within the core area are via a main-\ntained, free, convenient fleet of Golden Gotham loner bikes positioned \nin 80 convenient bike racks. \nBudget Theme Statement\nThe 10 percent auto traffic reduction goal is \nachieved with a low initial cost because the \nbikes come from unclaimed property. \nNote that all three theme statements link the auto traffic \nreduction goal to a specific feature of the applicant’s program.\nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS and THEME \nSTATEMENTS.\n10\t  DIRECTLY LINK PROJECT OBJECTIVES, ACTIVITIES, MILESTONES, AND COSTS. \nLinking proposed activities to at least one objective suggests \nthat the activity is necessary. Linking milestones to an \nobjective suggests you know how to manage the activities and \nmeasure progress. Linking all costs to objectives suggests that \nall costs are necessary. \nWhen grant writers fail to link objectives, activities, milestones, \nand costs, reviewers question their necessity. Linking them  \nall suggests that you understand exactly what you will do \nwhen funded. \n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n106\n©Shipley Associates\nSee RELEVANT \nEXPERIENCE/PAST \nPERFORMANCE, \nfigure 4, for a related \nexample matrix.\n11 \t LINK ALL EXPENSES TO REQUIRED ACTIVITIES AND EMPHASIZE ADDED VALUE. \nLinking expenses to required activities is an extension of \nguideline 10. Presenting a total budget is easier for the writer \nthan for reviewers, who cannot easily determine if all items are \nnecessary. \nPrepare your standard budget, but then allocate all items \nagainst the activities. Split categories among activities. Present \nyour allocated budget, not the combined budget. \nEmphasize added value in \nyour budget. For example, an \norganization seeks $20,000 to \ntrain, supervise, and motivate \n100 volunteers that each \ndonate 2 hours weekly over 1 \nyear (a total of 10,000 service \nhours following training). The grant writer could argue that \nvolunteers’ time at $15/hour is worth $150,000. Thus, the value \nproposition for the funder is to spend $20,000 for $170,000 \nworth of services. \nNo one wants to pay for anything that appears unnecessary, \nespecially the individuals charged with selecting programs \nto be funded and monitoring their performance. A program \nmanager for a government agency, corporation, or foundation \nwould feel pretty good about spending $20,000 for $170,000 \nworth of services. \nDo not feel that what you are proposing to do is so deserving \nthat you must be funded. Good grant writers present all \nprograms as deserving. Give reviewers a quantitative as well as \nan emotional justification to fund your program. \nWhile many applicants use \nunpaid volunteers, quantifying \nthe value of volunteer hours \nmight give you an edge over \nother applicants.\nSee APPENDICES. All aspects \napply to grant proposals. \n12\t SUPPORT ALL CLAIMS. \nEmphasize your claims and support them. Preserve your \ncredibility with reviewers by removing unsupported claims. \nNote that support and proof differ. Support requires at least \none example. Proof is much stronger and more difficult to \nsubstantiate. \nFor example, delivering a service one time is support that you \ncan do it again. Proving that you can deliver a service every \ntime requires a 100 percent successful track record. \n13\t LIMIT APPENDICES TO REQUESTED MATERIAL. \nIf the materials are not requested or required, do not include \nthem. Do not place materials in an appendix because you \nthink they are interesting, because you always include them, \nor because you think the grant application should have asked \nfor them. Instead, focus your attention on the most important \npages, the body of the proposal. \nAppendices are used to streamline documents. Incorporate \nmaterials of interest to all reviewers in the proposal. Place \nmaterials of interest to only a few readers in an appendix. \nGrant writers often append complimentary news clippings, \ncitations, awards, thank-you letters, service photos, facility \nphotos, and quotes from local officials and organizations. \nThe best way to link objectives, activities, milestones, and costs \nis in a matrix. Constructing this matrix will test and improve \nyour understanding of your program. \nBecause few grant writers link objectives, activities, milestones, \nand costs, your program appears clearer, better managed, \nlower risk, and more cost effective. \n\nGrant Writing\nShipley Proposal Guide\n107\n©Shipley Associates\n14\t USE EMPHASIS DEVICES TO ENGAGE REVIEWERS, SIMPLIFY REVIEW, SHORTEN \nTHE PROPOSAL, AND RAISE YOUR SCORE. \nThe best grant proposals are about the service, not the \nprovider of the service. Use all of the emphasis devices \ndiscussed in this Proposal Guide to emphasize your services. \nPhotos and graphics may have many interpretations. Do not \nput in a photo just because it is a great photo. The photo must \nbe directly relevant to the services proposed. Figure 2 shows \nfour photographs and notes why they should or should not be \nused in a particular proposal. \nP H O T O  E X A M P L E S\nThis photo emphasizes an individual with a service dog, but it \ncuts off the top half of the individual. While this shows one use a \nservice animal may provide, it does not highlight the benefit to \nthe recipient.\nThis photo is ideal. The dog is shown between two teens who \nlook happy and relaxed. The feature (a support dog) and its \nbenefit (dopamine increase) are clearly communicated.\nIn this photo, the entire emphasis is on the dog. In a grant \nfor providing animal services to at-risk teenagers, this \ndemonstrates none of the benefits for the proposed service.\nWhile this photo shows a dog providing service, water safety \nis not the service that the non-profit Pups for People sponsor. \nUsing this image in the grant could confuse potential funders \nand detract from the organization’s purpose.\nFigure 2. Selecting Appropriate Photos. The photos above are examples of possible images to use in a grant. Imagine you are writing a \ngrant for the non-profit organization Pups for People. The goal of this organization is to provide emotional support dogs to at-risk teenagers in \nOrlando, Florida. Depending on the photo selected as an emphasis device for the grant, the program could be confused with the others that a \npotential funder would not support. A photo is an effective emphasis tool when it highlights both features and benefits.\nWhile well-received, the approach with the most impact is to \nincorporate excerpts in the proposal to directly support your \nclaims. Do both when space and time permit.\nRefer to all appended materials in the body of the proposal. \nInclude short informative summaries of each appended item. \nPlace appendices in the following order:\n•\t As requested in the grant application\n•\t As referenced in the proposal \nTo clearly distinguish the proposal and the appendix, number \nproposal pages and letter appendix pages, A-1, A-2, . . ., B-1, etc. \nGrant applicants often do not meet directly with funders. \nInstead of stuffing an appendix with additional and costly \nmaterials, list the materials, services, and presentations you \nprovide as available upon request. If they bite, you get an \naudience that others might not \nget. This proven sales tactic can \ngive you a significant advantage.\nSee all sections listed under the \nDocument Design heading in \nthe topical table of contents for \nexplanations and examples.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n108\n©Shipley Associates\nGRAPHICS\nHigh-level readers of proposals, those either making or \ninfluencing the selection decision, often only skim proposals, \nlooking at the graphics that stand out, then reading the \ncaptions, headings, highlight statements, and the executive \nsummary. These readers must be able to see why you should \nbe selected without reading body text.\nEvaluators reviewing each question and requirement will often \nget together and ask two questions:\n•\t “Did anyone find anything about . . . ?”\n•\t “Which proposal is the best proposal?”\nEffective graphics leave overall positive \nimpressions and can make it easy for \nevaluators to find detailed answers to \nquestions.\nStudies of retention show that after \na single reading, evaluators will \nremember twice as much of what they see in a graphic as \nwhat they read in text. In addition, when evaluators both see \nand read the same point, they recall six times as much. The \nkey elements in retention were repetition and dual modes of \nacquisition. \nWriters of winning proposals tend to both visualize and state \nwhy they should be selected.\nToo many proposal writers still think that their customers are \ndifferent or that their readers might be turned off by graphics. \nSuch writers justify their lack of graphics with statements like, \n“Our evaluators are scientists, engineers, or accountants. They \njust want the facts.”\nGraphics done well are the facts. Poor, inappropriate graphics \nare an insult to the evaluator.\nToday’s readers see professional graphics in business \ndocuments, magazines, newspapers, TV, and movies. They \nexpect similar quality graphics in professional proposals.\nThe wide availability of high-quality graphics, graphics \ngeneration software, and color printers make it feasible to \ncreate eye-catching, professional graphics and integrate them \ninto a proposal.\nThe most successful sales people save time and stay on \nmessage by using similar graphics throughout the sales cycle. \nReuse essentially the same graphics in sales presentations, \nwhite papers, executive summaries, proposals, and finals or \nshort list briefings. Repetition increases retention. Just adapt \ngraphics to the situation and medium.\nGraphics are one of the most effective ways to persuade the customer to select your solution. Graphics convey both facts \nand emotion, equally important aspects of effective persuasion.\nGraphics have a \nmultiplier effect on \nyour message. Done \nwell, your message is \nremembered vividly; \ndone poorly, your mes-\nsage is obliterated.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n109\n©Shipley Associates\nGRAPHICS\nSelect or create graphics that demonstrate \nyour understanding, emphasize your strategy, \nand highlight your discriminators.\nConceive the graphics before you \nwrite the text.\nSelect graphics that best support your message.\n1\n2\n3\nIntegrate graphics into the text.\nOrient graphics vertically.\nMinimize cumbersome foldouts.\n7\n8\n9\nDesign or modify graphics until they are \nunderstandable.\n4\nMinimize text in graphics.

People buy benefits, not features, so \nvisualize the benefits—similar to the following  good examples:\nLaundry soap commercials show \nhappy people going somewhere in \nclean clothes.\nRestaurants show diners enjoying \nthemselves.\nCell phone ads show people enjoying \nthe ease and fun of new, innovative \nsmartphone features.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n110\n©Shipley Associates\nA photo in an aircraft engine proposal \nshowed a huge, complicated engine \nwith a seven-piece tool kit in the \nforeground. An informative caption \nemphasized that the engine could be \nmaintained with the seven tools.\nWhen selling complex technologies and services, helping the \ncustomer visualize the product, as shown in figure 1, is usually \nmore effective than describing aspects of the product in dense \ntext. Note the benefits in the caption.\nCustomers are usually purchasing an improvement in their \ncurrent process. Show potential process improvements in \ngraphs, charts, sketches, or photos. Even when competitors \noffer the same solution, the one presented graphically  \nappears superior. \nVisualize your discriminators to help evaluators remember \nyour differences, while associating your discriminators with \nthe benefits to their organization. \nSide-by-side comparisons are particularly effective in \nhighlighting discriminators:\n•\t Current process/proposed process\n•\t Complex process/simplified process\n•\t Old product/new product\n•\t Side-by-side graphs, bar, or pie charts\t\nNote the side-by-side comparison in figure 2 that compares the \ncurrent and proposed layout of windows in a house. Even the \ncaptions are separate to heighten the contrast.\nBecause graphics are highly emphatic, use them to convey \nimportant information.\nThe following examples represent poor ways graphics have \nbeen used:\nA proposal graphic occupied an entire page showing a single finger \npressing a single button on a phone set.\nProposals include cliched clip art sketches of clasped hands to repre-\nsent a proposed partnership (even when not requested), a light bulb \nto represent a good idea, or smiley faces to represent happy users.\nCustomers seek benefits \nand care relatively little \nabout the process as long \nas you appear to have \na method to deliver the \nbenefits.\nFigure 1. Minimizing Text in Graphics. Graphics are more easily conveyed to the evaluator when the text is simple and minimized.

Write the text last. Do the things first that \nwill have the greatest persuasive impact on the evaluator. \nPreparing graphics first is a huge time saver, often cutting \nwriting time by one-third. Everyone wants to wordsmith text. \nAfter completing the graphics, writers often find they have \nmuch less text to write.\nIf text is drafted before the graphic is developed, most writers \nresist deleting the now-redundant text.\nProposals often contain long descriptions of processes that \nwould be better depicted in a graphic. Figure 3 shows first aid \nprocedures for treating bee stings. Text descriptions could take \npages. The graphic uses a fraction of the page and is clear. \nFigure 3. Depict Processes Graphically. This four-part graphic \nexplains a process much more easily, clearly, and briefly than could \nbe done using only text. Prepare similar graphics to explain complex \ntechnical processes and eliminate the cumbersome and ineffective \ntext descriptions that most sellers use. \nRemove the stinger.\n1\n2\nUse a cold pack to reduce swelling at the site.\n3\nUse an antihistamine to reduce swelling and itching.\n4\nMonitor for hives, redness, or itching \nin other areas of the body.\nAllergic reactions to a sting are medical \nemergencies. Get immediate help.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n112\n©Shipley Associates\nMany proposals are for technical services. The written \ndescriptions of these services are frequently too complex to be \nunderstood, and the complexity suggests greater risk.\nInstead, depict your service processes graphically as shown in \nfigure 4. Often the only discriminator among contractors is the \nclarity of the explanations of their services.\nAnother bonus—you can reuse these graphics in every \nproposal for the same services and eliminate pages of  \nboring text.\nEvaluators often say, “We looked at the tables, charts, and \ngraphics first. If we found the answers, we did not bother to \nread the text.”\nThe entire storyboarding process used to create winning \nproposals is focused on designing proposal sections \ngraphically in response to the bid request and then conceiving \nappropriate graphics. \nFigure 4. Use Graphics to Sell Your Processes. This graphic  \nshows an excellent way to eliminate tiresome prose or bullet \npoints describing a process. Once developed, graphics like this \ncan be used in multiple proposals. Clarity implies simplicity, which \nsuggests low risk. \n4-step Website Design Process. Simple and proven \nprocesses are more reliable. Our designers take time \nto plan the site. Once that has been approved, the \ndevelopment starts. After development designers test \neach item and its functionality, they test the entire website \nto ensure users can easily navigate each webpage.\n1. PLANNING\n2. DEVELOPMENT\n3. TESTING\n4. LAUNCHING \nSee STORYBOARDS AND \nMOCKUPS: CONTENT \nPLANNING TOOLS\n3\t\nSELECT GRAPHICS THAT BEST SUPPORT YOUR MESSAGE.\nThe type of graphic you select should depend on the point you \nwant to make with the evaluator. Figure 5 summarizes which \ntypes of graphics can be used to best support your message.\nDo not select graphics simply because they are available. Keep \nthe following selection guidelines in mind:\n•\t Charts show relationships or the flow between items. \n•\t Graphs show correlations, trends, or comparisons, \ndepending on whether it is a line, bar, or pie graph.\n•\t Photos show realism, that the item exists.\n•\t Illustrations show specific features and eliminate \nextraneous detail that could be confusing in a \nphotograph.\n•\t Maps and drawings show relationships, often to scale. \n•\t Callout boxes frame key points and benefits with color \nshading or font styles to attract the evaluators’ attention \non the page.\n•\t Tables emphasize actual numbers. When the absolute \nvalue of the number is most important, use a table. When \na comparison or trend is most important, use a graph.\n•\t Tables can emphasize correlations between words in \ndefinitions, descriptions, and glossaries. They can be \nplaced early in a section or in a summary to emphasize \nkey points, benefits, and features of your solution.\nFor example, when discussing your salary, do you want to \nsee a graph (trends in salaries) or the amount you will be paid \n(table of comparable salaries)? For most, comparability is \nmore important than the trend. If you start low enough, the \ntrend looks great, but you are still underpaid.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n113\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 5. Support Your Message with Appropriate Graphics.

Executive summary graphics must \nbe understandable by all potential readers, including non-\ntechnical ones. \nWithin a proposal and proposal sections, you can increase \nthe technical complexity of both graphics and text. Begin with \na succinct, clear summary that is broadly understandable. \nThen increase the complexity as needed to satisfy your more \ntechnical evaluators. The less technical evaluators will have \nquit reading and jumped to the next section. Apply this \nguideline to both graphics and text.\nWhile highly technical proposal sections will have more \ncomplex graphics, only include sufficient detail to make them \ncorrect. Proposals are not technical treatises, and readers \noften perceive overly technical graphics as arrogant.\nSome of the most useful stock materials for a proposal writer \nare boilerplate graphics. Always tailor boilerplate graphics for \nthe evaluators of each proposal.\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n114\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nKEEP GRAPHICS SIMPLE, UNCLUTTERED, AND EASY TO READ, WITH ONE KEY \nIDEA PER GRAPHIC.\nLike good paragraphs, good graphics have one key point. If you \nrealize that you have several points, divide them into several \ngraphics. \nWhen brainstorming graphics, ask yourself these questions:\nMany large organizations bidding government programs \nhave prepared elaborate macro graphics that portray the \nentire program. These graphics are \nunderstandable after they have \nbeen explained for 30 minutes. They \ndo not work well in a proposal with \na single paragraph caption. Very \nfew evaluators have the patience to \nfigure them out.\nKeep the 10-Second Rule in mind. If evaluators cannot get the \npoint in 10 seconds, they will turn the page. Does the graphic \nin figure 6 pass the 10-Second Rule with you?\nFigure 6. Use the 10-Second Rule to Check Your Graphics. All but \nyour most technical graphics should pass the 10-Second Rule. Graph-\nics like the one shown above are confusing without additional infor-\nmation. An evaluator should be able to grasp the graphic’s concept \nquickly. As you evaluate your graphics, consider how long it takes you \nto understand each graphic. Did the graphics capture your interest? \nDid you get the message within 10 seconds?  \nA better approach is to explain complex concepts through a \nseries of graphics that build to your point. \nA proposal writer was assigned to explain the management structure \nfor a 2,600-employee contractor-operated government facility. He \ndeveloped a five-page foldout that extended from the company pres-\nident to first-level supervisors and through all 12 business units. The \ndraft caption title was, “Top Management Visibility.”\nThe complexity of the organization chart and the large number of \nlevels between the president and the proposed organization contra-\ndicted the message in the caption.\nThe fix was one graphic showing the senior management link to the \nproposed facility manager, a second graphic showing the 12 operat-\ning departments, and a third graphic showing each department. \nThe final series of 14 charts told the management story simply and \nconvincingly. Each graphic had an extended caption, some taking \n1/4 to 1/3 of a page. No additional body text was needed beyond the \nsection summary and introduction.\nSome graphics cannot be saved; they must be reconceived and \nrecreated, as shown in figures 7 and 8. In figure 7, the help desk \nprocess is outlined in the smallest type. The circle suggests a \ncontinuous cycle, and the graphic is cluttered with numerous \ndepartment names. \nThe intent was to emphasize that a single call would lead to \nthe resolution of a customer’s problem. Figure 8 emphasizes \nthe single call to the help desk while downplaying the source \nof help. Figure 7 is seller focused; figure 8 is customer-focused.\nFigure 7. Seller-Focused Graphic with Non-Descriptive Caption. If \nyou bother to figure out this graphic, you might get the impression \nthat calling the seller’s help desk leads to a runaround response. \nWhile perhaps realistic, this was not the message intended.\nWhat is the overall point I am trying to make?\nHow much room is available to create graphics?\nWhat is the most important idea that I must \ncommunicate?\nWhat is the central concept?\nHow are we different in this area?\n?\n?\nWhat is unique, desirable, or beneficial?\nComplex graphics become \nclearer over time—to the \nseller.

Customer-Focused Graphic with an Action Caption. In \ncontrast to figure 7, the title adds “responsive” to emphasize the \nbenefit to the customer. The action caption explains the process, \nincluding features and benefits.\nTo reduce rework, decide on the finished size of your graphic \nbefore it is drawn. Frequently, graphics are drawn in one size, \nthen reduced to fit, making lettering hard to read or line width \ninappropriate. \nWhen writers have graphics assistance, ask each writer to \nspecify an approximate finished size, such as full-page, half-\npage, or quarter-page. Alternatively, specify column inches, \ndepending on your page design.\nWell-designed graphics have a foreground, middle-ground, \nand background. Foreground objects are centered or slightly \noff-center, appear in front, have greater line width, or are more \nvisible through the use of color or size. \nMiddle-ground items show the overall object or \nconcept. These items are usually sketched with medium-\nweight lines and are less brightly colored. \nBackground items are used to establish context, enhance \nrealism, and add balance. Background items are behind or to \nthe side of fore- and middle-ground objects and are sketched \nwith lighter, narrower lines in more neutral colors.\nNothing stands out when graphics are drawn with the same \nline width and color throughout, as illustrated in the poor \ngraphic in figure 9.\nSee COLOR.\nResponsive Help Desk Process. Any user experiencing a \nproblem makes a single call to the ACME help desk. The \nACME operator can identify and solve most problems. \nSome problems will require the assistance of other support \nexperts, but all assistance is managed through the help \ndesk to minimize the need to make callers start over with \neach new expert.\nCustomer\n(Experiences problem)\nACME \nHelp Desk\n(Identiﬁes and \ndispatches problem)\nSecurity\nNetwork \nSupport\nSoftware \nSupport\nTech Support\nResolves problem\nFigure 9. Poorly Designed Graphic. The uniform line width, lack of \ncolor, and excessive labeling of irrelevant details ensure that nothing \nstands out. The complete lack of a caption in the original graphic \nensured that the evaluator did not get the point intended.\n6\t\nINTRODUCE GRAPHICS IN THE TEXT BEFORE THEY APPEAR IN THE PROPOSAL.\nIntroduce every graphic in the text before it appears in the \nproposal. Readers encountering a graphic that has not been \nintroduced may get confused.\nIntroduce the graphic by telling how it fits with or supports \nother proposal content. You do not have to repeat the content \nof the graphic in your text. For reinforcement, make the same \npoint in different words.\nMake your introduction informative and specific:\nFigure 3 indicates how we helped a major services company in \t\nSweden raise its capture percentage to 68 percent.\nOur seamless, multi-cloud data transfer process is shown in figure 4.\nAvoid noninformative introductions like this:\nSee figure 5.\nOur organization chart can be found in figure 6.\nLike a good action caption, a good \nintroduction puts the spin on the \ngraphic that you want, helping the \nevaluator interpret its meaning. \nAlso avoid unnecessarily breaking columns of text to insert a \ngraphic if the reader could be confused about where to read \nnext. Such confusion is common in proposals with multiple \ncolumn page designs.\nSee ACTION CAPTIONS, \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY, \nand PAGE AND  \nDOCUMENT DESIGN.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n116\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nINTEGRATE GRAPHICS INTO THE TEXT. \nTo enable evaluators to refer to a graphic without turning \nthe page, place graphics on the same or the facing page. \nEvaluators asked to turn to another page, or worse, an \nappendix, usually do not. \nAvoid referring to graphics as a group:\nOur approach to facility construction is shown in figures 1 through 14.\nTechnical and scientific writers traditionally place all graphics \nat the back for the convenience of the writer. Make your \nproposal easy to read for the evaluator by integrating your \ngraphics into the text.\nSee APPENDICES.\n8\t\nORIENT GRAPHICS VERTICALLY.\nDesign your proposal to enable the evaluator to read it without \nrotating or steering the book. Avoid any action that interrupts \nthe flow of ideas from the document to the reader.\nIf you have numerous graphics better suited to a horizontal \nor landscape page, consider orienting the entire volume in \nthe same direction. Cost volumes full of spreadsheets are a \ncommon example.\n9\t\nMINIMIZE CUMBERSOME FOLDOUTS.\nFoldouts have numerous drawbacks:\n•\t Take extra time for the evaluator to unfold and refold.\n•\t Make your proposal look much thicker.\n•\t Lead to larger, complex graphics that are harder to \nunderstand.\n•\t Often get torn, removed, or lost from handling.\n•\t Require a separate production process followed by error \nprone insertion in each volume at the last minute.\nUse foldouts when needed, typically for the following types  \nof graphics:\n•\t Project schedules\n•\t Staffing charts\n•\t Cross-reference matrices\n•\t Engineering drawings\n10\t MINIMIZE TEXT IN GRAPHICS. CONCENTRATE TEXT IN AN ACTION CAPTION.\nConcentrate the text with your primary message in the \naction caption where you can use word processing tools like \nspellcheck, search, and replace. Production costs are also \nreduced by letting word processing handle the text and letting \nthe artists do graphics.\nInsert keys and legends that enable evaluators to understand \nthe graphic, but try to group them to reduce clutter rather than \ninserting them wherever you have space.\nWhen given the choice of using direct labels on items or a key, \nuse direct labels unless the excessive number of labels clutters \nthe graphic. Remove labels from items not being addressed. \nBy minimizing text in graphics, graphics are easier to tailor for \nsubsequent proposals without embarrassing inclusions of the \nwrong client or product name.\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n117\n©Shipley Associates\nTHE SYSTEM\n •  Dashboard display unit \n •  Operating software and help system\n •  Compact GPS (Global Positioning System)\nADVANTAGES\n •  Real-time information\n •  Voice activated directions\n •  Shortened routes\nThe SAT System uses GPS to establish \nyour vehicle’s exact location and provides \ndirections to other destinations.\nFigure 10. No Artist—Still No Excuse. Some graphics just draw attention to the text message. In this example, any motorcycle graphic would \nhave worked. Do not let the lack of a skilled artist stop you from using graphics in proposals.\nMinimizing text in graphics is a guideline with many \nexceptions. The graphic in figure 10 has extensive text; \nhowever, the text is grouped and organized for maximum \nclarity. Note the simplicity of the graphics in figure 10.\nWhen using text in a graphic, the font size should adhere to the \nRFP. If there are no guidelines for font size, the text in graphics \nshould be no smaller than 10 pt.\nWhile having skilled graphics support is a great aid to \npreparing winning proposals, you can use relatively simple \ngraphics to attract a reader’s attention, as shown in figure 10. \nAnyone can find a picture of a motorcycle. The motorcycle \nattracts the reader; the text conveys the message.\nConsider the following similar examples, all used in proposals:\n•\t Table of Contents—to show the contents of a plan\n•\t Letter of Commendation—to show excellent, relevant \nexperience\n•\t Certificate—to show compliance with established \nstandards\n•\t Procedure—to show an approach or evidence of a proven \napproach\n•\t Template/Form—to demonstrate the item already exists\n•\t Sidebar—to label specialized content\n\nGraphics\nShipley Proposal Guide\n118\n©Shipley Associates\n11\t NUMBER GRAPHICS IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE IN MAJOR SECTIONS.\nTo make evaluation easy, refer to all graphics as figures or \nexhibits and number them consecutively within major sections \nof your proposal.\nRefer to both tables and figures as figures. With many forms \nof blended graphics, such as tables inserted within a figure, \nadopt a single naming convention to simplify the process for \nboth the evaluator and yourself.\nIn a short proposal, label all graphics consecutively. In \nproposals with multiple sections, label them consecutively \nwithin sections. Use the section number, an en dash, then the \nfigure number.\nFigure 3–2. Informative Title. Full sentence(s) action caption.\nTo facilitate matching graphics with section drafts, use the \ncomplete section number during proposal development.

Place \nthe list of figures immediately behind the table of contents for \neach volume.\n12\t INCLUDE AN INTERPRETATIVE ACTION CAPTION WITH EVERY GRAPHIC.\nAction captions interpret the graphic for the evaluator.

Unlike formal theme statements, which are \nsometimes not read by evaluators, informative headings are \nnearly always read. \nHeadings enable formal evaluators, those looking for answers \nto specific evaluation questions on a score sheet, to rapidly \nlocate answers. Informal evaluators, those skimming for \ncontent on specific topics, can also rapidly identify content of \ninterest. \nLike graphics and white space, headings help break up bleak \nmasses of text, making your proposal more readable.\nHeadings are essential features of a good proposal. They enable evaluators to quickly find answers to their questions.\nHEADINGS\nUse the exact heading dictated in the bid request.\nUse telegraphic headings to label major sections.\nUse informative headings in all other instances.\n1\n2\n3\nLimit numbered headings to three levels unless \ndictated by the bid request.\n4\nUse verb headings to convey action; use noun \nheadings to signal your purpose.\nMake the bulleted list of contents and section \nsubheadings identical in proposal sections \nwith an informal table of contents.\nSignal the level of heading by placement on the \npage, size of type, type appearance, and section \nnumber.\n5\n6\n7\n\nHeadings\nShipley Proposal Guide\n120\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nUSE THE EXACT HEADING DICTATED IN THE BID REQUEST.\nHeadings may be directly dictated or implied in a bid request. \nDirectly dictated\nBid request excerpt:\n2.0   Management Plan\n1.\t  Organization and Facilities. Include a current organization \nchart and a brief description of operational function. Describe \nyour organization in terms of size and \norganizational stability. Identify relevant \nfacility resources (e.g., word processing, \ngraphics generation, DTP, and printing).\nProposal section headings:\n2.0   Management Plan\n        2.1   Organization and Facilities\nIf the bid request refers to Project Management, then do \nnot change it to Program Management, even if that is your \norganization’s usual term. Call it what the customer calls it. \nIf the customer hyphenated the title, Integrated-Systems \nEngineering, then you hyphenate it, however unconventional. \nEXCEPTION: If the \ncustomer misspells a \nword, you should not \nrepeat the misspell-\ning in your document.\n2\t\nUSE TELEGRAPHIC HEADINGS TO LABEL MAJOR SECTIONS.\nRecommended telegraphic headings in a proposal include \nmajor, expected, or standard sections. \nTelegraphic headings only label content:\n•\t Executive Summary\n•\t Management Summary\n•\t Technical Proposal\n•\t Cost Volume\n•\t Appendix\nMost of these will also fall under the first guideline, headings \ndictated in the bid request.\nTelegraphic headings are generally less desirable because they \nare not very interesting and are less likely than informative \nheadings to capture the attention of busy readers. \nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\n3\t\nUSE INFORMATIVE HEADINGS IN ALL OTHER INSTANCES.\nInformative, specific headings enable evaluators to \nimmediately determine both the contents of a section and \noften the benefit to their organization. \nInformative headings are like newspaper headlines. They \nconvey the essence of the story and create interest before \nyou read the story. Good, informative headings make any \ndocument more user friendly, enabling the evaluators to make \nan informed choice about what and how much they read \ndepending on their interests and needs.\nMany proposal section headings are general and not \ninformative:\nIntroduction\nOrganization\nDesign\nImplementation\nWhile these headings qualify as good telegraphic headings, \nuse them primarily when dictated by the bid request \ninstructions. More informative versions would be:\nHow Our Proposal Is Organized to Ease Your Evaluation\nOur Flat Organizational Structure Reduces Overhead Cost\nT700 Bearing Design Based on Successful Demonstration Program\nContinuous Support Through a Three-Phase Implementation\nMake informative headings inclusive to signal that only \nmaterial mentioned in the heading will be covered in the \nsection. Proposal writers use boilerplate often violate  \nthis recommendation.\nBusy, skeptical evaluators are more likely to read an \ninformative heading than a formal theme statement. Exploit \nthis by giving your informative headings many of the features \nof good theme statements:\n1.\t Link a benefit to a feature\n2.\t Cite features that are discriminators\n\nHeadings\nShipley Proposal Guide\n121\n©Shipley Associates\nEmulate these examples of informative, inclusive headings \nthat contain both features and benefits: \nCut Bearing Lubrication Downtime 20 Percent with Our Unobtanium, \nTapered Design\nDetecting Malignant Tissue in Real Time Using Biotec’s Laser Probe\nDOE Has Unlimited Access to All Proposed Sites to Speed the Phase II \nPermitting Process\nGain Comprehensive IT Expertise in the Financial Industry\nAvoid Start-Up Fees by Continuing the Current Contract\nMaximize Business Capture Effectiveness by Selectively Outsourcing \nProposal Management\nMany proposal writers worry that their informative headings \nbecome too long when they follow these recommendations. \nWhile evaluators have made negative comments about long \ntheme statements, they rarely complain about informative \nheadings being too long. \nSee DISCRIMINATORS and \nTHEME STATEMENTS.\n4\t\nLIMIT NUMBERED HEADINGS TO THREE LEVELS UNLESS DICTATED BY THE  \nBID REQUEST.\nProposals are accessed rather than read. Evaluators search for \nanswers to questions, either formally or informally.\nTwo devices help evaluators find the information they want:\n•\t Numbered or lettered headings\n•\t Cross-reference matrix or compliance matrix\nUse a numbering system with your headings on all but the \nshortest proposals, approximately five pages or less. \nThe cross-reference matrix links the specific question in the \nbid request to the proposal section number and heading \nwhere the question is answered.\nIf your cross-reference matrix does not contain page numbers, \nyour subsection number should direct evaluators to within \nthree pages of the answer. Then an informal table of contents \nat the beginning of the section and matching unnumbered, \nrun-in subheadings should take the evaluator to the paragraph \nwith the answer. \nUsing run-in subheadings is an effective way to facilitate \nevaluation by indicating content without adding more \nnumbered headings. \nA Run-In Heading. When you do not use punctuation, make the \nheading visually distinct from the rest of the text. Use boldface type or \na larger typeface.\nAlways follow the client’s bid request numbering and heading \nsystem, regardless of level. One such proposal required \nheading subsection levels 8, 9, and 10.\nThe levels of headings may be indicated by the numbering \nsystem, placement, size, or appearance of the heading. When \ngiven the choice, use numeric decimal numbering systems \ninstead of alpha numeric systems to \nminimize potential reader confusion:\n4.2.3.7   vs.    IV.B.3.g\nGenerally, the less technical your readers, the fewer levels you \nshould use. \nLarge, formally solicited \nproposals often need four to \nfive numbered heading levels. If \nyou cannot direct the evaluator \nto within a few pages of the \nanswer, add another level. Ease of \nevaluation is more important than \nlimiting heading levels.\nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS.\nCross-reference matrices \noften do not contain page \nnumbers because the \npage number is not known \nuntil the final document is \npublished. Including page \nnumbers in the cross-refer-\nence matrix is desirable but \noptional.\n\nHeadings\nShipley Proposal Guide\n122\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nUSE VERB HEADINGS TO CONVEY ACTION; USE NOUN HEADINGS TO SIGNAL \nYOUR PURPOSE.\nWhen given a choice, keep headings parallel in structure. \nParallel headings use the same grammatical structure. Parallel \nverb headings begin with a verb in the same tense. Verb \nheadings tend to be more active and persuasive. \n3.1 \t\nCut Bearing Lubrication Downtime 20 Percent with Our Un-\nobtanium Tapered Design\n4.2.1\t Detect Malignant Tissue in Real Time Using Biotec’s Laser \nProbe\n5.3\t\nGain Comprehensive Computer Expertise in the Financial \nIndustry\n8.7.4\t Avoid Start-Up Fees by Continuing the Current Contract\nNoun headings begin with a noun or noun clause and tend to \nbe more useful when answering the bid request \nquestion in the heading to avoid forcing evaluators \nto read the text.\n7.2\t\nDOE Has Unlimited Access to All Proposed Sites to Speed the \nPhase II Permitting Process\n8.1\t\nCloud Platform Compatible with All Major Systems\nLimit or entirely avoid using question headings in proposals. \nQuestion headings may leave the impression with some \nevaluators that you do not know the answer.\n2.0 \t\nCan Global Corporation Cut IT Costs?\n2.3 \t\nHow Does Titanium Hold Up in Space?\n3.3 \t\nIs it Possible to Retrain Existing Personnel?\n5.1.1\t Can Enemy Missiles Be Detected in Time?\nSee LISTS. \n6\t\nMAKE THE BULLETED LIST OF CONTENTS AND SECTION SUBHEADINGS  \nIDENTICAL IN PROPOSAL SECTIONS WITH AN INFORMAL TABLE OF CONTENTS.\nWriters that follow the fundamental principles of sound \nsection organization often list topics in their section \nintroduction, then draft informative headings for the \nsubsequent subsections. \nIntroduction\nIn our meetings over the past 3 months, your medical technicians said \nthe tumor diagnostic system must have the following characteristics:\n•\t Accurate\n•\t Available\n•\t Cost-effective\nSubsection headings could be written as:\nTest Accuracy Increased from 98 to 99.9 Percent\nAvailability Demonstrated at 95 Percent  \nOver Two Years of Clinical Use\nBeta Users Show Six-Month Payback\nWhile all the headings reflect the same topic and convey \nimportant messages, skimming evaluators might not see the \nimmediate connection.

Conversely, a \nwriter eliminates material that is not relevant to the immediate \nproposal but forgets to change the introduction.\nWith multiple writers, a writer may decide to add or delete \nmaterial without also realizing that the material is previewed \nin the introduction. A poor solution is to eliminate all \nintroductions or previews. Unfortunately, this solution may \nbe worse than the original lack of agreement between the \nintroduction and the order of subsequent section content.\n7\t\nSIGNAL THE LEVEL OF HEADING BY PLACEMENT ON THE PAGE, SIZE OF TYPE, \nTYPE APPEARANCE, AND SECTION NUMBER.\nPlacement variations include centering, flush left, indented, \nand run-in. \nA Centered Heading\nA Flush-Left Heading\nAn Indented Heading\nA Run-In Heading.

In this instance, the designer \nmay have chosen readability over emphasis. However, \nemphasis may be enhanced by increasing point size more \nsignificantly, using a different color, or using a noticeably \ndifferent serif font.\nAvoid using too many different types of fonts. For greater \nconsistency, use the same font for all headings, and, perhaps, a \ndifferent font for body text. Some designers choose to use the \nsame font for both headings and body text. Often designers \nwill choose a font created in both serif and sans-serif versions. \nThe decision of how to apply fonts is usually subjective. Set \nyour style and be consistent.\nSee PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT \nDESIGN.\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n124\n©Shipley Associates\nINTERNATIONAL PROPOSALS\nThe global economy encourages international competitive \nbidding and often a more structured evaluation and decision-\nmaking process. \nPolitical considerations, \nsocioeconomic arrangements \nand investments, protectionism, \nand teaming with local \norganizations all play  larger roles \nwhen acquisition rules are not \ntightly defined.\nWinning bids integrate aspects of the solution, competitive \nsituation, and price. In addition to the obvious differences \nin cultural customs and communication, consider how \nyou will adapt your solution to the local business and legal \nenvironment, management structures, management and \nreporting systems, tax structures, utilities, and infrastructure. \nInternational business English is the most common language \nfor commerce and often the only common language among \ndiverse individuals in the customer’s organization. \nThe following guidelines help you with the writing, \nmanagement, and production of the proposal.\nInternational proposals need to be led by individuals who are familiar with—and preferably native to—the laws and culture of \nthe customer. If you aim to win significant opportunities, develop proposal capabilities of your in-country personnel.\nEvery country has different \nacquisition systems. \nInternational proposals take \non many forms and variations. \nBidders must be acutely tuned \nto specific business practices, \ncustoms, standards, and laws.\nINTERNATIONAL PROPOSALS\nRespect the customs and culture of \ncustomers’ countries.\nAdapt your solution to the local business customs \nand legal environment, management structures, \nmanagement and reporting systems, tax structures, \ninfrastructure, and evaluation approach.\nUse your normal capitalization, spelling, and \npunctuation when writing to a foreign contact in English.\n1\n2\n3\nRecognize that English usage varies \nsignificantly worldwide.\nPrepare the proposal near the customer \nwhen possible.\nUse translation services cautiously.\n7\n8\n9\nUse customers’ spelling conventions \nwhen replying to formal bid requests.\n4\nAdjust your proposal preparation schedule.\n10\nKeep your writing clear, short, and concise.\nUse more graphics, but keep \nthem simple.\n5\n6\nOffer a read-through, oral presentation, \nand question-and-answer session to \nensure your proposal is understood.\n11\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n125\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nRESPECT THE CUSTOMS AND CULTURE OF CUSTOMERS’ COUNTRIES.\nThe circumstances surrounding proposals and business \ndevelopment vary widely between countries, cultures, and \norganizations. Meticulously observe the usage and practices of \neach country.\nWhat you should do is also significant. Find out what \nyou can do to proactively create a positive impression. \nLocal employees or representatives are vital and a formal \nmechanism should be put in place to evaluate and implement \ntheir recommendations for localization. Take into account \nthe relative status of the local representative and the cultural \nnorms that influence their ability to assert the importance of \nimplementing their suggestions.\nLocal personnel will know the customs and can help you avoid \nawkwardness, embarrassment, or perhaps directly insulting \nthe customer. \nConsider this example:\nA Scottish businessman working for a U.K. corporation was pursu-\ning business in Hong Kong, China. After working closely with a local \nrepresentative and the local office staff, he impulsively decided to buy \na simple gift valued at £10 sterling for a Hong Kong staff person who \nhad put in many hours of overtime on their proposal. When presented \nwith the gift, the staff person became extremely upset and immedi-\nately left the room. \nThis businessman later learned that in the Chinese culture, gifts of \nany value are exchanged, not given unilaterally. His gift had caused \na loss of face because the staff person had no return gift immediately \navailable.\nMost business guides emphasize what you \nshould not do:\n•\t Do not criticize your contact or the \nperson’s country.\n•\t Do not impose your pace or schedule on \nthe customer.\n2\t\nADAPT YOUR SOLUTION TO THE LOCAL BUSINESS CUSTOMS AND LEGAL           \nENVIRONMENT, MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES, MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING \nSYSTEMS, TAX STRUCTURES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EVALUATION APPROACH. \nCustoms can impact your solution as much as laws. For \nexample, the age, gender, or religion of an individual \nmight limit the ability of that individual to travel, meet, or \ninteract with the customer. Presumed intellectual property \nprotections and the interpretation and enforcement of your \ntypical contract terms and conditions might be invalid or \nunenforceable when bidding internationally. \nManagement structures, individual roles, and variations \nin management and reporting systems often impact your \ncustomary project management, delivery, reporting, and \nbilling processes. Tax structures differ and governance rules \nthat evolved over decades might be totally unexpected from \nyour viewpoint. Local personnel and experts can help you \nunderstand these variables.\nPresumptions about the availability and reliability of \ninfrastructure also vary globally. Securing local permits might \nprompt significant schedule changes and add unanticipated \ncosts.\nEvaluation approaches vary. Consider any document that you \nuse to advance the sale to be a proposal. Understand how it \nwill be used and what the customer expects; then design your \ndocument to exceed expectations.\nUnderstand each customer’s confidentiality practices and \nregulations. Comply with the laws governing the sale and be \naware that in some cultures, bids are shared with other bidders.\nEvaluators and decision makers are not only available but may \nexpect to be contacted as an indication of your interest. The \nonly rule is that the customer is in control of the guidelines \nfor bidding.\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n126\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nUSE YOUR NORMAL CAPITALIZATION, SPELLING, AND PUNCTUATION WHEN \nWRITING TO A FOREIGN CONTACT IN ENGLISH.\nWith no other rules defined, customers expect you to be \nyourself. Unless otherwise directed, use your normal approach \nfor informally solicited proposals as well as the other business \nand sales documents that surround the proposal.\nFollow the style customers use for their titles, name, company \nname, and address. Check their websites and other public \ninformation to understand language usage and practices.\nBe careful when mixing written material with American \nspelling and a U.K. English speaker, or conversely, U.K. English \nspelling and an American speaker. \n4\t\nUSE CUSTOMERS’ SPELLING CONVENTIONS WHEN REPLYING TO FORMAL  \nBID REQUESTS.\nFollow the rules of the dialect used by the customer. There \nare multiple dialects in many languages that affect spelling \nand word usage. American, British, Canadian, and Australian \nEnglish, for example, use s and z differently.\nWhile keeping sentences short, do not omit words for \neconomy, as if sending a text message. Omitted words often \nconfuse readers:\nNot this\nWill upload proposal p.m. to customer site.\nThis\nWe will upload our proposal this afternoon to Global Bank’s website. \nWhile using the same spelling convention, you do not have to \nuse the same format and font as was used in the bid request \nunless directed to do so by the customer.\nThe capitalization, punctuation, and spelling style you use \nis not as important as being consistent. Consistency both \nconveys professionalism and makes it easier for foreign \nreaders to understand your message.\n5\t\nKEEP YOUR WRITING CLEAR, SHORT, AND CONCISE.\nUse short and simple words, sentences, and paragraphs. In \ninternational proposals, complexity can cause translation \ndifficulties as well as confusion and misunderstanding.\nWhenever possible, choose a short word over a long, complex, \nunfamiliar, or abstract word. While this guideline applies \nuniversally, it is even more critical in international proposals.\nAny sentence having more than 20 words is more difficult to \nunderstand. An easily readable newspaper, like USA Today, \naverages about 15 words per sentence and one or two \nsentences per paragraph. Too many short sentences tend to \nmake the writing seem choppy, so writing instructors advise \nvarying sentence length and using transition words. However, \nchoppiness is not the primary concern in international \nproposals. If your proposal is translated, it will probably seem \nchoppy, independent of how the original sentences were \nwritten. \nSentence fragments cause severe \ndifficulties for international readers. Delete \nfragments or rewrite them as complete \nsentences. Evaluators that struggle to understand your \nmeaning are unlikely to absorb content. \nAvoid idioms—peculiar or specialized expressions which are \nused daily but are unfamiliar to members of the culture you \nare addressing. Idioms are cultural jargon and closely related \nto gobbledygook. \nHere are a few examples: \nIDIOM\nSYNONYM\nbear in mind \nconsider\nworkaround\ntemporary fix, alternate approach\nbe of one mind\nagree\nput up with\ntolerate\nput down\ninsult\ninput\nenter (computer) or comment, suggestion\nEvaluators repeatedly say that they favor pro­posals that \nare easy to read and evaluate. Clear, short, concise words, \nsentences, and paragraphs make international proposals \neasier to read and evaluate.\nSee CHOOSING \nCORRECT WORDS, \nGOBBLEDYGOOK, \nand JARGON.\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n127\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nUSE MORE GRAPHICS, BUT KEEP THEM SIMPLE.\nGraphics can be universally understood, can summarize \ninformation and concepts quickly, and may reduce the total \nsize of a proposal.\nHowever, foreign evaluators may not understand complex \ngraphics without reading the supporting text that they are \nalready challenged to understand. Simplify all graphics as \nmuch as possible and include a title and a complete action \ncaption for each graphic.\nSee ACTION CAPTIONS, \nCOLOR, and GRAPHICS.\n7\t\nRECOGNIZE THAT ENGLISH USAGE VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY WORLDWIDE.\nThe notion that English is English everywhere in the world is \nnot accurate. Most are aware that U.S. and U.K. English vary, \nwith many identical words having different and potentially \nembarrassing or offensive meanings. \nAcronyms may also have different connotations in different \nregions, even within the same industry. In rail operations, for \nexample, TOC is used to mean Train Operating Company in the \nU.K. but in Australia refers to Train Operating Conditions.\nJapanese English often does not distinguish between singular \nand plural words because Japanese speakers do not have \nsingular and plural in their own language and may not be \naccustomed to making such distinctions. \nEgyptian English deviates from U.S. English by treating certain \nadjectives as nouns: He is from the Egyptian [delegation].\nAmerican English tends to turn verbs into nouns and nouns \ninto verbs more frequently than U.K. English. Words such as \nauthor and euthanize are not commonly accepted as verbs in \nU.K. English. Yet finalize, editorialize, nationalize, publicize, and \nminiaturize are accepted. (Apologies to the U.K. English readers \nfor the spelling.) Until commonly accepted, avoid using words \nthat might divert or offend evaluators.\nAmerican English speakers and writers often add unnecessary \nprepositions to verbs. Many readers and listeners in both \nnations are distracted and irritated by these unnecessary \nprepositions. Eliminate them.\nConsider the following replacement terms:\nUNNECESSARY  \nPREPOSITIONS\nCORRECTED\nfaced up to\nfaced\ndeliver on\ndeliver\nhead up\nhead\ncheck out\ncheck\ncheck up, check up on\ncheck\nconsult with\nconsult\nfree up\nfree\ndivide up\ndivide\ncook up\ncook\nvisit with\nvisit\nskirt around\nskirt\ncombine together\ncombine\njoin together\njoin\nplan in advance\nplan\n“In service” is jargon. \nAvoid unnecessary \njargon, especially in inter-\nnational proposals.\nSee JARGON.\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n128\n©Shipley Associates\nDifferences between U.S. English and U.K. English include \ndifferent spellings of the same word, different meanings for \nthe same word, and different words for the same meaning.\nThe examples in figure 1 illustrate how differences in \nunderstanding of the same language can lead to trouble \nor embarrassment. Be aware if you intend to propose \nsuccessfully to people who are more fluent in U.K. English than \nin U.S. English.\nU.S.\nU.K.\nbathroom\nlavatory\nbiscuit\nscone\ncenter\ncentre\ncookie\nbiscuit\ndefense\ndefence\ndessert\npudding\nelevator\nlift\ngas, gasoline\npetrol\ninventory\nstocks\nlabor\nlabour\nlucked out (lucky)\nlucked out (NOT lucky)\nparking lot\ncar park\npavement\nroad\npay raise or hike\npay rise\nprogram\nprogramme\nrealize\nrealise\nsales \nturnover\ntable (put aside)\ntable (act on now)\nFigure 1. U.S. Versus U.K English. Word usage and spelling varies \namong English speakers.\n8\t\nPREPARE THE PROPOSAL NEAR THE CUSTOMER WHEN POSSIBLE.\nPrepare the proposal geographically near the customer \nwhen possible. Remotely-prepared proposals are often less \ncustomer-focused and subject to misalignment to local \ncultures.\nIdentify a staff that can write, present, and interpret customer’s \nreactions. Even when English is the customer’s primary \nbusiness language, discussions, analysis, and evaluation are \noften in the native language.\nIf you must prepare the proposal away from the customer, add \na local representative to the team.\n9\t\nUSE TRANSLATION SERVICES CAUTIOUSLY.\nIf the customer requires translation or you decide to translate \nall or portions of your proposal, proceed cautiously. Be \nvery particular about the translator’s credentials. Multiple \ntranslations from different people are ideal.\nIn-country translators are a must. Even good U.S. translators \nseldom know local ways.\nDue to the high risk of incorrect translation, use English unless \ndelivering a translated proposal is part of your strategy. At \nbest, an error can be embarrassing; at worst, it can cause you \nto lose the opportunity.\nReview translated work carefully, especially names, numbers, \nmoney, and statistics. Consider having particularly sensitive \nportions back-translated to verify the translation has remained \ntrue to the original.\nComputerized translation is improving rapidly but is not yet \nsufficiently reliable.\n\nInternational Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n129\n©Shipley Associates\nDesign graphics and pages with translation in mind. \nDepending on the language, allow 20 to 30 percent more space \nfor text expansion.\nExpand your running glossary of acronyms and unique terms \nto aid the translator.\nTo avoid problems in translation: \n•\t Develop a list of key terms and agree with the translation \nteam the words that will be used to replace them. Avoid \nusing alternative terms that may confuse the reader. \n•\t Keep the translation team as small as possible to reduce \nthe potential for linguistic variations, inconsistencies, or \nerrors.\n•\t Translate only from the base document to reduce \nthe potential for lost meaning due to translations of \ntranslations.\n10\t ADJUST YOUR PROPOSAL PREPARATION SCHEDULE.\nAny customer can use missed deadlines as the reason to \neliminate your proposal. Varying languages, time zones, \ncultures, technologies, and laws usually increase the time \nrequired to produce a winning proposal. Build in an extra 5–10 \npercent of time to allow for these variations.\nTranslation often applies to many of the bid documents as well \nas the proposal. Discrepancies in the translated documents \ntake more time to resolve, so plan accordingly.\nDifferent time zones usually increase the time required. While \nmany teams have writers in different time zones working \naround the clock, you still have the same number of writers \navailable, and the communication time overlap might be \nnarrow. \nManagement reviews become more complex and reviewers \nare less likely to be co-located, thus leading to conflicting \nrecommendations. Take all regulatory and technology \nlimitations into consideration when planning proposal \nreviews.\nProduction time might increase with \nchanges in paper size (A4 vs. Letter) or the need to deliver \nelectronic copy. Shipping takes longer and is often subject to \nCustoms problems. Consider printing hard copies in the local \nmarket whenever possible.\nSee SCHEDULING.\nMost countries outside \nthe U.S. use A4-size pa-\nper, a metric standard \nthat measures:  \n210 mm x 297 mm   \n(8.268 in. x 11.693 in.).\n11\t OFFER A READ-THROUGH, ORAL PRESENTATION, AND A QUESTION-AND-ANSWER \nSESSION TO ENSURE YOUR PROPOSAL IS UNDERSTOOD.\nCustomers managing international competitions are acutely \naware of and worried about the risks of misunderstanding \nsuppliers’ proposals. Offering to make or even sponsor a read-\nthrough will reduce customers’ risk and potentially improve \nyour position. Read-throughs give you the chance to observe \ncustomers’ understanding and to clarify your offer.\nAn oral (virtual or in-person) presentation followed by \nquestions and answers is a good alternative to the read-\nthrough and takes less time. These options may raise \nproposal preparation costs, require more time, and require \nmore resources.\n\nJargon\nShipley Proposal Guide\n130\n©Shipley Associates\nJARGON\nJargon often reduces the persuasiveness of documents, and \nexcessive, unfamiliar jargon can even give them an arrogant \ntone. Many proposal evaluators are not as expert as the writer, \nand using jargon may obscure meaning. Because both experts \nand non-experts evaluate proposals, be clear and concise, \navoiding jargon where it might be misinterpreted.\nJargon can be 1) familiar language \nused in an unfamiliar way, 2) \ntechnical or specialized language \nunfamiliar to a particular reader, \nor 3) a mixture of both familiar \nand specialized language.\nConsider the following examples:\nYou have to see our hot new radar.\nHot, a familiar word, can be misinterpreted in a variety of ways \nincluding: high temperature, trendy, or even stolen. \nOperator efficiency is improved in monitors with a smaller dot-pitch.\nDot-pitch is a technical term that would have to be explained \nfor many readers.\nThere are many key drivers to internal company change.\nDrivers is a common word with specialized meanings, but it is \nused in this sentence in what could be an unfamiliar context \nfor some readers.\nJargon is specialized language used among members of a group or profession. Use jargon only when customers will be \nfamiliar with it and then only when plain English will not suffice.\nJARGON\nMinimize jargon. Define necessary \njargon for non-expert readers.\n1\nUse the customer’s jargon before using \nyour organization’s jargon.\n3\nEvery technical discipline or \nprofession needs a spe-\ncialized vocabulary, but be \naware that using jargon can \nobscure meaning for readers \nwith different backgrounds.\nReplace jargon with plain words \nwhen feasible.\n2\n\nJargon\nShipley Proposal Guide\n131\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nMINIMIZE JARGON. DEFINE NECESSARY JARGON FOR NON-EXPERT READERS.\nMinimize jargon in executive summaries, section summaries, \nand themes, which are more likely to be read by non-experts. \nWriters using unfamiliar jargon may confuse or alienate the \ncustomer. \nWhile not strictly the same, abbreviations are a type of \njargon. In proposals, treat jargon like abbreviations; define \nit the first time the word is used in each major section that is \nlikely to have different evaluators or readers. Using too many \nabbreviations can make a proposal unreadable.\nJargon and gobbledygook are not the same. Good writing can \ninclude some jargon if the jargon is defined or understood in \ncontext. Good writing never includes gobbledygook.\nMinimize jargon in international \nproposals. Even when your jargon is \ndefined, unfamiliar jargon is less likely to \nbe persuasive and remembered. \nAdditional examples of common business and proposal jargon \nare listed in figure 1.\nSee ABBREVIATIONS \nand GOBBLEDYGOOK.\nJARGON\nAcquisition stream-\nlining\naction plan\nBest-in-class\nbest value\nCore business\ncore competency\ncost effective\ncutting edge \nDownsize\nEmpower\nenterprise\nGovernance\ngranularity\nHeadcount\nIndustry-leading \nJoint venture\nKnowledge manage-\nment\nLeverage\nMake redundant\nmarket driven\nmission-critical\nmission statement\nParadigm\npartnering\nRight-size\nStrategic alliance\nTask force\ntelecommute\nUncompensated \nOvertime\nWorld class\nFigure 1. Examples of Common Business Jargon. Use jargon cautiously, only when essential to express the correct meaning and if this  \ncustomer will perceive it positively.\n2\t\nREPLACE JARGON WITH PLAIN WORDS WHEN FEASIBLE.\nProposal writers often must choose whether to use customers’ \nexact words or clear, impactful, plain English. Plain words are \nmore persuasive and the best choice.\nFor example, the bid request requires the system to be \ndesigned for maximum maintainability. Many proposal writers \nwould repeatedly use the phrase maximum maintainability to \ndescribe their system. \nConsider what phrase an advertising agency would use \nto describe the system. The agency would stress that the \nsystem was easy to fix or easy to repair. Which phrase is more \nmemorable, concise, and clear?\nUse or reflect the customer’s language, but replace it or equate \nit with plain words when feasible.\n3\t\nUSE THE CUSTOMER’S JARGON BEFORE USING YOUR ORGANIZATION’S JARGON.\nJargon might be specific to an industry and an organization. \nTypes of jargon are listed in order of acceptability:\n•\t Customer’s jargon\n•\t Industry or business jargon\n•\t Professional jargon\n•\t Seller’s jargon\nThe acceptability of jargon is in direct correlation to the \nnumber of individuals using that jargon in the customer’s \norganization and the power of those individuals.\nUltimately, customers determine whether jargon is acceptable. \nHence, proposal writers must know their customers well. One \ncustomer may dislike common business jargon, while another \nmay expect to see these terms used.\nSee INTERNATIONAL \nPROPOSALS.\n\nKickoff Meeting\nShipley Proposal Guide\n132\n©Shipley Associates\nKICKOFF MEETING\nKickoff meetings should be motivational, informative, and \ndirective. Kickoff meetings have the following objectives:\n•\t Initiate contributors’ proposal efforts\n•\t Answer questions about the opportunity\n•\t Make writing assignments\n•\t Coordinate upcoming activities\n•\t Create a cohesive team\nKickoff meetings range from carefully planned and executed \nlarge-team efforts to loosely structured web conferences. \nResist the urge to have a kickoff meeting as soon as you  \nreceive the bid request. Premature kickoff meetings offer \nthe illusion of progress and lead to more rework and a less \ncompetitive proposal. \nThe proposal manager should lead kickoff meetings, \nsupported by the capture/opportunity manager.\nLarge-team proposals might have as many as four  \nkickoff meetings:\n1.\t The teaming or subcontractors’ kickoff follows the \nformal commitment to team or subcontract. The \npurpose is to establish clear roles, responsibilities,  \nand assignments.\n2.\t The proposal kickoff follows two events:  \n(1) bid decision and (2) subsequent planning that \nenables the core team to issue clear task assignments to \neach proposal contributor.\n3.\t The proposal update kickoff follows the Bid Validation \nreview, prompted by receipt of the customer’s final bid \nrequest, and redirects each contributor’s efforts based \non changes in the customer’s bid request.\n4.\t The cost kickoff establishes estimating ground rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, schedules, costing strategy, and \ntask assignments.\t\nFewer than 10 percent of all proposals have multiple  \nkickoff meetings.\nDo not confuse your initial proposal planning meeting with \na kickoff meeting. The event called the kickoff meeting for \nmany organizations is actually an initial planning meeting, \nconducted in a conference call. These misnamed meetings \nloosely cover the following topics:\n•\t Customer requirements and perhaps motivators and  \nhot buttons.\n•\t Available solution, often incorrectly termed our strategy.\n•\t Broad area assignments, such as, “Fred has the technical, \nMary takes the management, and Jim’s group can do  \nthe production.” \n•\t Schedule, “We’ll talk again next week. Your completed \nproposal section is due on . . . ”\nTo make proposal team kickoff meetings more successful, \nthe following guidelines stress planning before the kickoff \nmeeting, and execution in a single setting, or execution via \nteleconference or web conference. \nTeleconference or virtual kickoff meetings are the only option \nfor many organizations. If this is the case in your organization, \ncarefully read guideline 7.\nNearly all materials distributed at the kickoff meeting are  \npart of the Proposal Management Plan (PMP) or its appendices \nand attachments. \nKickoff meetings are critical milestones that require careful core team planning followed by professional execution. Good \nones inspire teams; poor ones demoralize teams.\n\nKickoff Meeting\nShipley Proposal Guide\n133\n©Shipley Associates\nKICKOFF MEETING\nAllocate approximately 15 percent of the \navailable preparation time to core team planning \nprior to the kickoff meeting.\nInvite the right people.\nPrepare a complete but concise agenda.\n1\n2\n3\nReview operational guidelines for \nproposal development.\nEstablish a tone of competent, professional \nproposal leadership and management.\nEstablish ground rules for teleconference \nor virtual kickoff meetings.\n5\n6\n7\nPrepare a comprehensive kickoff \npackage in advance.\n4\n1\t\nALLOCATE APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT OF THE AVAILABLE PREPARATION TIME \nTO CORE TEAM PLANNING PRIOR TO THE KICKOFF MEETING.\nA 10-day proposal effort would allow 1 to 1.5 days to plan the \nmeeting. A 45-day effort would allow approximately 1 week. \nPreparation time will depend on draft bid request availability, \nyour organization’s willingness to commit to resources, core \nteam planning, and your Proposal Management Plan (PMP) \ncompleteness.\n2\t\nINVITE THE RIGHT PEOPLE.\nInvite the people whose work will be affected by the proposal, \neither by direct contribution, temporary loss of resources, or \nconsequences:\n•\t Senior managers who support and help motivate the \nteam\n•\t Program or product managers who own the solution\n•\t Capture, sales, opportunity, and/or marketing leads who \nrepresent the customer and align the proposal to sales \nefforts\n•\t Proposal manager who is tasked to produce a proposal\n•\t Volume or section leads who manage portions of the \nteam\n•\t Writers and contributors who develop content\n•\t Proposal specialists or coordinators who help the \nproposal manager coordinate section drafts and graphics\n•\t Desktop publishers who will format and publish the \nproposal\n•\t Production supervisor who will copy the proposal\n•\t Editors and graphic artists who are assigned to support \nthe proposal\n•\t Managers who are committing resources to the proposal \neffort\n•\t Teaming partners and \nsubcontractors who provide \ntext or pricing, providing they \nare exclusive to your bid and \nhave signed teaming and \nnondisclosure agreements\nEvery proposal of any size requires a sponsor or owner—\nranging from a management executive \nto the account executive. An executive \nsponsor for the proposal effort will \nhelp you get the right people for your \nproposal, from planning the kickoff meeting to submittal and \nnegotiation. Major proposal efforts that cannot attract an \nexecutive sponsor should be reconsidered.\nExecutives in the most effective organizations view winning \nnew business as a critical activity worthy of assigning their \nbest employees. Executives in less-effective organizations tend \nto assign individuals they can spare or who are available. Make \nthe right people available rather than rationalizing that the \navailable people are right.\nSee SCHEDULING and  \nTEAM SELECTION AND  \nMANAGEMENT.\nTo comprehend the capture \nmanager’s role and perspec-\ntive regarding proposal kickoff \nmeetings, see SUPPORTING \nTHE PROPOSAL, Capture \nGuide.\n\nKickoff Meeting\nShipley Proposal Guide\n134\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nPREPARE A COMPLETE BUT CONCISE AGENDA.\nTarget between 2 to 3 hours for a kickoff meeting with 10 to \n30 contributors. Make the kickoff meeting informative and \nprofessional. Do not let it turn into a problem-solving event. \nLike daily stand-up meetings, when problems \nsurface, limit discussion to who needs to be \ninvolved and when that group can meet. \nA typical kickoff meeting agenda is shown in figure 1. Because \neveryone does not need to attend the entire meeting, arrange \nthe agenda to permit the unneeded participants to leave after \ntopics relevant to their roles are covered.\nEstablish a professional tone by distributing a copy of your \nagenda with the invitation to attend.\nSee DAILY  \nPROPOSAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\nK I C K O F F  M E E T I N G  A G E N D A\n5\nProposal Mgr\nWelcome everyone and introduce participants\n5\nSenior Mgr\nDeliver motivational remarks and indicate organizational commitment\n10\nSales, Capture, or \nMarketing Lead\nGive background on the customer and the opportunity\n45\nProposal Mgr\nDistribute and discuss the Proposal Management Plan (PMP), including outline, \nexecutive summary,  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), writers’ packages, and \nstoryboards (when used)\n10\nBreak\n. . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5\nTech Vol Mgr\nOutline technical approach\n5\nMgmt Vol Mgr\nOutline management approach\n5\nCost Vol Mgr\nOutline costing approach\n15\nProposal Mgr\nDiscuss daily proposal operations and schedule\n15\nProposal Mgr\nAnswer contributors’ questions and dismiss meeting\nTIME\nPERSON\nTOPIC\nFigure 1.

Teaming partners who have not yet signed a teaming agreement should usually be excluded.\n4\t\nPREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE KICKOFF PACKAGE IN ADVANCE.\nDetermine exactly what material you need to distribute at the \nkickoff meeting. Start with the PMP.\nManagers of smaller proposals in less \nstructured markets and organizations \nshould carefully review the recommended kickoff meeting \nmaterials listed in figure 2 and select those most relevant to \nyour proposal. \nSee PROPOSAL  \nMANAGEMENT PLAN, \nPROPOSAL  \nSTRATEGY, SCHEDULING, \nand OUTLINING.\n\nKickoff Meeting\nShipley Proposal Guide\n135\n©Shipley Associates\n  REQUIRED ITEMS\nCONTENT/FUNCTION\nProposal Project  \nSummary\nInformation about the opportunity, contract type, value, official name, relevant dates, key contacts, scope, \nprimary deliverables.

Recommended Kickoff Meeting Materials. To prevent serious misdirection of your proposal team, conduct the kickoff meeting after \npreparing most of these materials. \n5\t\nREVIEW OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT.\nEstablish clear operational guidelines at the kickoff meeting to \nminimize rework. \nThe simpler you can make it for contributors to follow your \nguidelines, the more likely they will actually follow them. \nGive writers a word processing file template. Writers asked to \nread long instructions and correctly set up a file may ignore the \ninstructions.\nClear operational guidelines will help achieve the following \naims:\n•\t Assess assigned task status.\n•\t Facilitate inputting, editing, developing and integrating \ngraphics, and reviewing.\n•\t Coordinate writing tasks among writers.\n•\t Update and disseminate new \ninformation.\n•\t Develop and roll up cost data.\n•\t Verify consistent task \ndescriptions and costs.\n•\t Increase senior management review and endorsement.\n•\t Identify and close gaps early to stay on schedule.\n•\t Verify drafts are compliant, responsive, and supportive of \nyour strategy.\nSee STORYBOARDS AND \nMOCKUPS: CONTENT \nPLANNING TOOLS,  \nPROPOSAL STRATEGY, and  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY.\n\nKickoff Meeting\nShipley Proposal Guide\n136\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nESTABLISH A TONE OF COMPETENT, PROFESSIONAL PROPOSAL LEADERSHIP \nAND MANAGEMENT.\nContributors enjoy working on a team that has senior \nmanagement visibility and support, professional leadership, \na clear win strategy, adequate resources, and a good chance \nof winning. You cannot fool your team into thinking you are \ncompetent when you have failed to plan before asking for  \ntheir help.\nAn ideal time to demonstrate your competence and \nprofessionalism as a proposal manager is at the kickoff \nmeeting. Plan and prepare well to help your team succeed.\nContributors enjoy \nworking on a team \nthat has senior \nmanagement \nvisibility.\n“ \n”\n7\t\nESTABLISH ADDITIONAL GROUND RULES FOR TELECONFERENCE OR VIRTUAL \nKICKOFF MEETINGS.\nTeleconference or virtual kickoff meetings \noften have these major business \ndevelopment weaknesses:\n•\t No defined process to prepare proposals\n•\t Unclear understanding of roles and responsibilities\n•\t Little consequence for late task completion\n•\t Rewards go primarily to the nonparticipants\n•\t General view that proposals are not important\n•\t A “proposals are free” mentality—those deciding to bid \ndo not pay for the proposal or do the work\nEstablish these practices:\n•\t Separate the initial core team planning meeting from \nthe proposal kickoff meeting. A small core team can \nresolve issues and make decisions faster without wasting \ncontributors’ time.\n•\t Establish lines of authority. The ranking person in the \nvirtual meeting from each participating organization must \nmake and stand by their decisions. Participants are not \npermitted to go back to their organizations for approval. \nAny organization that fails to participate must abide by \nthe decisions of those who did.\n•\t Establish a detailed, written agenda and distribute it early \nenough to permit participants to prepare.\n•\t Take the time to poll participants for acceptance after \neach agenda item. Obtain closure on each item and \nsummarize the decision. \n•\t As tasks are assigned, ask the responsible individuals to \nrestate their understanding and acceptance.\n•\t Assign someone other than the person chairing the call to \nkeep detailed minutes. \n•\t Email or post a copy of the minutes to all participants \nand their managers a few hours after the meeting is \ncompleted. Ask them to confirm their acceptance.\n•\t Check progress of a dispersed team more frequently than \nwhen your team is co-located. No news is bad news when \nyour team is dispersed. \n•\t Test your submission process for hardware and  \nsoftware compatibility.\nSee VIRTUAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n137\n©Shipley Associates\nLETTER PROPOSALS\nStructure letter proposals, executive summaries, and sales \nletters similarly. Keep them customer-focused and structured \naround the customer’s hot buttons or key issues. \nToo many letter proposals are deemed boilerplate documents \nthat incorporate standard descriptions of the proposed \nproducts and services. \nInstead, regard every document sent to a customer as a \nproposal. Each sales document must convince the customer’s \norganization to agree to take the next step toward your overall \nsales objective.\nLetter proposals are short proposals, often not formally solicited, ranging from 1 to 20 pages. When acceptable to the customer, \nuse letter proposals to minimize competition and to reduce or eliminate proposal preparation and evaluation costs. \nLETTER PROPOSALS\nClarify the customer’s expectations before \npreparing an unsolicited letter proposal.\nUse the flexible four-box organization.\nUse an informative subject line and \nincorporate a signal word.\n1\n2\n3\nIn the body of your proposal, align your proposed \nsolution to the customer’s most relevant hot button.\nConclude with a short summary and a clear \nindication of the next realistically achievable step.\nUse graphics with captions to \ndiscriminate your letter proposal.\n6\n7\n8\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY; SALES \nCOMMUNICATION,  \nCapture Guide.\nIn your introduction, connect your solution to the \ncustomer’s objectives. \nPreview the proposal’s organization \naccording to the customer’s hot buttons.\n4\n5\nInclude an executive summary comprising no more \nthan 5 to 10 percent of the proposal.\nLimit attached or appended materials to items \nspecifically requested by the customer or essential \nto specialist readers.\n9\n10\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n138\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nCLARIFY THE CUSTOMER’S EXPECTATIONS BEFORE PREPARING AN  \nUNSOLICITED LETTER PROPOSAL.\nExplicitly discuss what information your customer will need \nin your proposal to make a decision. How can you meet your \ncustomer’s expectations unless you know what they are?\nUse language similar to one of the following examples to \nclarify customers’ expectations:\nApproach 1: You said that you will need a proposal before you can \nmake a final decision. To make sure you get what you need, let’s talk \nabout what you would like to have included in our proposal. \nApproach 2: You have used our products/services for years. To simplify \nyour evaluation, shall we eliminate all the usual corporate back-\nground and history and focus specifically on what we plan to do on \nthis project? \nApproach 3: If we agree to limit the proposal to 20 pages on the \nspecifics of this project, we can eliminate 100 pages of background, \ncorporate history, and standard product descriptions and deliver the \ndocument that you expect in 4 days. Would this be acceptable to your \nevaluation group? \nWhile getting the order without a proposal is ideal, remember \nthat purchasing professionals are trained and purchasing \nprocesses are designed to require a proposal. Competition \noften both improves the quality of the solution and reduces \nthe cost.\n2\t\nUSE THE FLEXIBLE FOUR-BOX ORGANIZATION.\nUse the four-box organizational structure to prepare \npersuasive, clearly organized, and expandable letter \nproposals. The four-box organizational structure is based on \nfundamental principles of document organization.\nThe four-box structure for any \ntype of sales document includes \na heading and four distinct boxes. \nThe heading is treated as a separate \ncomponent and not included in Box 1.\nBroadly viewed, the objective for each of the four boxes in a \ngeneric sales document is as follows:\n•\t Box 1: Summarize the document.\n•\t Box 2: Preview the document’s organization, arranged \naccording to the reader’s hot buttons or issues.\n•\t Box 3: Link the hot buttons to the writer’s solution  \nor key information. This is the body or main part of  \nthe document.\n•\t Box 4: Summarize the document and suggest the  \nnext step.\nWhile letter proposals, executive \nsummaries, and sales letters should \nall follow the four-box organizational \nstructure, each will vary depending on the seller’s objective, \nthe targeted evaluators or readers, and the complexity of  \nthe information.\nThe greatest differences among letter proposals, executive \nsummaries, and sales letters are in the contents of Box 1. The \nsuggested content for each of the four boxes for the three \ntypes of sales documents is compared in figure 1. Guidelines \n4 through 7 discuss the content of each of the four boxes of a \nletter proposal.\nThe four-box organizational approach is flexible in several ways. \nFirst, some of the suggested content might be omitted, appear \nin a different order, or be placed in a different box. For example, \nthe statement of compliance might be omitted because it is \nimplied in other text, or it might be placed in Box 3 or 4 because \nit is relatively less important than other information.\nAnother type of flexibility with the four-box approach is that \ndocuments can be expanded or reduced to better match the \nimportance of the information and the necessary level of \ndetail. Figure 2 shows the four-box organizational approach \napplied to both 1- and 10-page letter proposals.\nSee EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, \nand ORGANIZATION; SALES \nCOMMUNICATION,  \nCapture Guide.\nSome of the listed  \nelements will be excluded \nfrom some letter proposals \ndepending on your history \nand relationship with the \ncustomer.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n139\n©Shipley Associates\nComponent\nHEADING TYPE\nType of Sales Document\nLETTER PROPOSAL\nInformative\n “Proposal to . . .”\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nTelegraphic \n“Executive Summary”\nSALES LETTER\nInformative\n  “Invitation, Request, etc.”\nBOX 1\nTheme Statement\nYes\nYes\nNot needed\nVision Statement\nYes\nYes\nNot needed\nLinking Statement\nYes, Vision-to-need\nYes, Vision-to-need\nYes, To previous event\nPreview Solution\nYes, “Solution”\nYes, “Solution”\nYes, “Request . . .” \nStatement of Compliance\nDesirable\nDesirable\nNot needed\nBOX 2\nIntroduce Hot Buttons\nYes\nYes\nYes\nExplicit Ownership\nYes\nYes\nYes\nBOX 3\nOrdered as in Box 2\nYes\nYes\nYes\nLink Hot Button to Content Yes\nYes\nYes\nDiscuss Price\nMandatory\nDesirable\nNot applicable\nBOX 4\nSummary\nYes\nYes\nYes\nSuggest Next Step\nYes, to negotiate\nYes, to read the proposal\nYes, to agree to seller’s request\nFigure 1.

Make the first  \nword a signal word that immediately announces the purpose \nof your letter:\nProposal\nRecommendation\nRequest\nInvitation\nContract\nStatement of Work\nAnalysis\nFinal Report\nWhen you omit these elements, customers often stop reading. \nWhether you want to label your proposal as a proposal depends \non your sales strategy. If the customer requested a proposal, \ncall it that. If you want to emphasize your consultative role, you \nmight begin with one of the other signal words. \nInformative subject lines include benefits when possible. \nBenefits immediately interest customers. Effective subject \nlines open with a signal word that defines the document’s \npurpose for the reader:\nProposal to Supply Drones at One-Half of Current Cost\nRecommendation to Immediately Contract for Legal Benefits to  \nEnhance Executive Retention\nInvitation to Contract for FY 20XX Cloud Support\nContract Provisions Approved August 1, 20XX\nSee HEADINGS.\n4\t\nIN YOUR INTRODUCTION, CONNECT YOUR SOLUTION TO THE  \nCUSTOMER’S OBJECTIVES. \nBox 1 of a letter proposal may include a theme statement, \nvision statement, linking statement, preview of the solution, \nand a statement of compliance. Several of these \nitems may be combined in a single sentence to \nbe concise. \nThe theme statement summarizes everything you want to \nsay in one sentence. Tie the benefit to your key discriminator. \nVision statements demonstrate how well you \nunderstand the customer’s overall direction \nand need. A customer will purchase from \nsellers who best demonstrate their understanding of the \ncustomer’s business and immediate needs. \nLinking statements that \ntie customers’ immediate \nneeds to the organization’s \nobjectives demonstrate your \nunderstanding and support \nfunding this project versus \ncompeting projects. \nThe preview of your solution is often only a phrase. In the first \nBox 1 example shown on the next page, the preview of the \nsolution is in the theme statement, “. . .  supply 20 versatile \ndrones [with] long-term support.” In the second example, the \nsolution is summarized in the first and last sentences, “ . . . \ncontracting with Able IT . . .”  and “ . . . an IT support partner . . .” \nSales and sales support professionals often voice two \nobjections:\n1.\t Don’t they already know their need?\n2.\t What if I get it wrong?\nFirst, of course they know. They need to be reassured that \nyou know. Second, if you cannot get it right, you should not \nbe bidding.\nNote how the two examples link the customer’s \norganizational objectives and immediate objectives to the \noffer and cite prior work.\nStatements of compliance are \nsomewhat controversial. Some \nprofessionals say they are  \nrequired. Others say compli-\nance is implied when a bid is \nsubmitted unless exceptions \nare stated in the bid. The \ncorrect answer is what the \ncustomer thinks.\nSee THEME \nSTATEMENTS.\nSee figure 4 in \nORGANIZATION.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n141\n©Shipley Associates\nLinking \nstatement to \nthe immediate \nobjective\nOrganizational \nvision and \nobjectives\nTheme \nstatement\nCASCADIA TIMBER REPORT\nCascadia Timber can reduce the cost of forest management \nin remote roadless areas by selecting a partner to supply 20 \nversatile drones packaged with long-term support.\nCascadia Timber is ranked as the No. 1 company in the \nworld by Foresters’ Monthly for low-cost, innovative forest \nmanagement. Cascadia Timber Chairman, Woody X. Pine, set \nthe following strategic direction:\nWe have to do everything better, more efficiently from a cost \npoint of view, and more effectively from an impact point of \nview.\nDuring our discussion over the past 6 weeks, you have \nindicated that Cascadia Timber’s Forest Management \nDivision helps improve efficiency and effectiveness by \nadopting innovative forest management practices.\nImmediate \nneed\nOrganizational \nvision and \nobjective\nFeather Bank can cut IT support costs by \n30 percent by contracting with Able IT, Ltd.\nHaving emerged from the recent industry \nconsolidation, Feather Bank is now the \nsecond largest and fastest growing bank \nin the Northwest. Bank One’s board \nchallenged management to increase ROI \nby 25 percent.\nIn our initial meeting 2 months ago, you \nstated that Feather Bank’s Operations \nDepartment would contribute to ROI \nimprovement by seeking proposals for an \nIT support partner that can reliably deliver \nsupport at a 30 percent cost reduction.\nTheme \nstatement\n5\t\nPREVIEW THE PROPOSAL’S ORGANIZATION ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOMER’S  \nHOT BUTTONS.\nBox 2 introduces the customer’s hot buttons for the current \npurchase. Brainstorm an extensive list of needs, issues, hot \nbuttons, key requirements, and evaluation criteria. Then \nconsolidate or group them into three to five distinct items. Use \nthe customer’s words.\nPrioritize them in one of two ways:\n1.\t Order of importance to the customer\n2.\t Order stated by the customer\nIdeally, the customer states the hot buttons in order of \nimportance. If you are not sure which hot buttons are more \nimportant, follow the order stated in the bid request, in other \ncustomer documents, or in discussions with the customer. \nThis becomes your hot button list. Now introduce the hot \nbuttons, making customer ownership explicit:\nPoor example (No Customer Ownership)\nThe ideal drone must meet four primary needs:\n1.\t Affordable and easily transportable\n2.\t All-conditions observation and communication platform\n3.\t Safe and easy to fly\n4.\t Easy to assemble and maintain in the field\nGood example (Explicit Customer Ownership)\nIn our meetings with Forest Management and Purchasing, you cited \nfour primary needs:\n1.\t Affordable and easily transportable \n2.\t All-conditions observation and communication platform\n3.\t Safe and easy to fly\n4.\t Easy to assemble and maintain in the field\nAll too frequently writers are asked to draft a letter proposal \nwhen they lack adequate customer contact or knowledge \nabout the customer’s needs. When this happens, set up the \ncustomer’s hot buttons based on what you do know:\nGood example\nOur experience with customers in the forest products industry has \nindicated that most cite four primary needs:\n1.\t Affordable and easily transportable\n2.\t All-conditions observation and communication platform\n3.\t Safe and easy to fly\n4.\t Easy to assemble and maintain in the field\nNote how the softer setup avoids being arrogant, gives you \nan out if you have the needs wrong, and validates your \nindustry experience.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n142\n©Shipley Associates\nPRIMARY REQUIREMENTS\nDISCRIMINATORS\nKEY POINTS\nBOX 3\nHOT BUTTON 1\nHOT BUTTON 2\nHOT BUTTON 3\n-Global’s Mfg Plant\n-List of facilities built in South America\n-Items from other lists\n-Facility photo\n-Items from other lists\n-Test report\n-ABC Corp Testimonial\n-Items from other lists\nSUBSTANTIATION\n-Global’s Mfg Plant\n-List of facilities built in South America\n-Facility photo\n-Test report\n-ABC Corp Testimonial\n6\t\nIN THE BODY OF YOUR PROPOSAL, ALIGN YOUR PROPOSED SOLUTION TO THE \nCUSTOMER’S MOST RELEVANT HOT BUTTON.\nTo keep your letter proposal brief \nbut comprehensive, you must link \nall of your points to one of the \ncustomer’s hot buttons, the ones \nlisted in Box 2. \nMake first-level subheadings \nin Box 3 identical in wording \nand order to the hot buttons \nintroduced in Box 2. Customers \nare confused when either the \nwording or order changes.\nFigure 3 illustrates how to identify and allocate your letter \nproposal content to a single section under one hot button. \nFirst, make lists of information you need to include in the \nproposal. Then, find a reasonable place for each item under \none of the hot buttons.\nOrganize your response to each hot button in the  \nfollowing manner:\n1.\t Succinctly state your solution to the requirement.\n2.\t Provide supporting details, either graphically or in text.\n3.\t Offer proof of experience and/or performance.\nOccasionally you will have \nsome additional content that \nmust be included but that \nclearly does not fit against \nany of the hot buttons. First, \nverify that it is relevant, then \nintroduce it between Boxes 3 \nand 4.\nLink pricing and costing \ninformation to a relevant hot \nbutton or place it between \nBoxes 3 and 4. The following \nhot buttons are typically  \nrelevant to pricing: \n•\t Reduce operating cost\n•\t Increase market  \ncompetitiveness\n•\t Deliver operational plant \nwithin budget\n•\t Payoff within 2 years\nLists of items you need to \naddress in the proposal\nFigure 3. Organizing Box 3 Based on Hot Button Priorities. First, list the primary customer requirements that you must address, your primary \ndiscriminators, key points, and relevant substantiation. Then allocate all items from each list in some reasonable manner under one of the hot \nbuttons. As there is no single, correct allocation, try to group similar items and present them logically.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n143\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nCONCLUDE WITH A SHORT SUMMARY AND A CLEAR INDICATION OF THE NEXT \nREALISTICALLY ACHIEVABLE STEP.\nSummarize the benefits the customer will enjoy from your \nsolution. List them in the order presented, as concisely as \npossible.\nThen proactively suggest the next step, usually a phone call or \nmeeting to resolve any questions and to finalize the contract.\nThe following example summarizes the seller’s offer in the first \ntwo paragraphs, then reinforces the seller’s compliance and \nflexibility and suggests the next step in the last paragraph.\nCascadia Timber has kept on the leading edge of innovative forest \nmanagement techniques. Airwind welcomes the opportunity to \nsupply 20 drones, flight and maintenance training, and long-term \nmaintenance and inspection support to further Cascadia’s leadership. \nWhile many drones are used for recreation, the Endeavor’s unique \n10-year use by Special Forces personnel over similar terrain and \nmore difficult conditions demonstrated its reliability in continuous \noperation. \nOur proposal addresses all issues discussed in our meetings. Should \nyour requirements change, we welcome the opportunity to discuss \nfurther enhancements. We will call you in 1 week to resolve any open \nitems and to agree on the next step.\n8\t\nUSE GRAPHICS WITH CAPTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE YOUR LETTER PROPOSAL.\nFew sellers use graphics in letter proposals. Emphasize the \nclarity of your thinking by using graphics with complete action \ncaptions in your letter proposal, shown in figure 4.\nConsider using the following types of graphics in a letter \nproposal:\n•\t Photos showing the product being used or the service \nbeing delivered\n•\t Photos of reference sites\n•\t Reference lists\n•\t Organization chart of the delivery team\n•\t Photos of the customer using or observing the product\n•\t Brief schedule\n•\t Pricing table\nSee ACTION \nCAPTIONS and \nGRAPHICS. \nThe Whistling Torch Eases Glassblowing. Our newly improved Whistling \nTorch quickly heats and softens any type of glass while consuming less fuel \nthan our previous torches. This allows users to create smoother glass pieces \nwith a clearer finish.\nFigure 4. Use Graphics to Emphasize Your Product or Service. Photos \nlike the one above effectively demonstrate the quality you can provide \nthrough your product or service. Using images or graphics to support the \ntext helps strengthen your letter proposal.\n\nLetter Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n144\n©Shipley Associates\n9\t\nINCLUDE AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY COMPRISING NO MORE THAN 5 TO 10  \nPERCENT OF THE PROPOSAL.\nEven with short letter proposals, include an executive \nsummary.\nYour executive summary need not be labeled. When using \nthe four-box organization, the informative heading and Box 1 \nconstitute the executive summary.\nExecutive summaries, previews, and closing summaries are \nintentionally repetitive because people remember the first \nitems they see, the last items they see, and repeated items. \nFew proposals, including letter proposals, are completely read \nfrom beginning to end. Repetition increases the probability \nthat they will get your key points.\n10\t LIMIT ATTACHED OR APPENDED MATERIALS TO ITEMS SPECIFICALLY  \nREQUESTED BY THE CUSTOMER OR ESSENTIAL TO SPECIALIST READERS.\nAttaching extensive materials to a letter proposal dilutes your \nmessage and negates the primary objective of submitting a \nletter proposal—to reduce the time and cost of preparing and \nevaluating proposals.\nIf you must attach materials, follow the \nguidelines for appendices. \nList the additional materials that are available but not included \nto ease their evaluation. Regard subsequent requests for \nmaterials as an opportunity to call on the customer when your \ncompetitors cannot.\nSee APPENDICES.\n\nLists\nShipley Proposal Guide\n145\n©Shipley Associates\nLISTS\nReaders are more likely to remember information presented in \na list, especially a display list.\nEvaluators searching proposals for answers to their questions \nuse display lists to spot information and to point them to \nwhere the information is discussed in body text.\nGuidelines for the optimal use of display lists in proposals \nare more specific and restrictive than in other business \ndocuments. \nProposals are read and accessed differently than most other \nbusiness documents. Virtually no one reads them completely \nor continuously. \nEvaluators are skeptical. They are trying to detect the spin in \nyour message; what information has been slanted, omitted, or \neven deliberately misrepresented.\nUnfortunately, many proposal writers use lists as a dumping \nground for information. They put unrelated items in a list \nbecause the information is available and when they do not \nhave a clear message in mind. \nLists serve two important functions in proposals: (1) emphasize important points and (2) preview direction.\nLISTS\nMake all items in lists parallel in structure. \nName each list.\nPlace the name of the list immediately \nin front of the list.\n1\n2\n3\nLimit your use of display lists to items \ndeserving emphasis.\nMinimize or eliminate confusing nested lists.\nBegin display lists with numbers or letters if you are \nmimicking the bid request numbering system.\n5\n6\n7\nLimit list contents to the \nitems named.\n4\nCapitalize the first word in each item. End all items \nwith a period only if at least one item is a complete \nsentence.\n8\n\nLists\nShipley Proposal Guide\n146\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nMAKE ALL ITEMS IN LISTS PARALLEL IN STRUCTURE. \nItems listed must be consistent in form and structure. Each \nitem begins with the same kind and type of word, e.g., verbs in \nthe same tense.\nBegin each item with the same kind of word (noun, verb, \nadjective, or adverb). Verb lists are the most effective type of \nlists in proposals because they convey a sense of action. \nVerb list\nThe Crystal Cloud communication platform includes the following key \nfeatures:\n•\t Integrates fully with client’s preexisting products\n•\t Replaces physical hardware\n•\t Increases file security\n•\t Offers low price packages\nAdjective list\nThe Crystal Cloud communication platform includes  \nthe following features:\n•\t Affordable\n•\t Integrable with preexisting products\n•\t Mobile-app compatible\n•\t Easy to use\nNoun list\nThe Crystal Cloud communication platform includes  \nthe following features:\n•\t Mobile app option\n•\t No physical hardware\n•\t File security\n•\t Connection with client’s preexisting products\nSee FEATURES, \nADVANTAGES, \nAND BENEFITS.\n2\t\nNAME EACH LIST.\nNaming a list makes your proposal easier to understand when \nevaluators skim or search for answers to their questions. \nNaming a list also increases the probability that the list is \nparallel. In an unnamed list, the reader must read the list and \ndetermine what the items are.\nUnnamed list\nOur project manager will:\n•\t  Plan all work.\n•\t Set quality standards.\n•\t Report progress weekly.\nUnnamed lists often become a dumping ground, especially \nwhen boilerplate is used extensively and deadlines are short.\nThe following named list is easier to understand:\nNamed list\nOur project manager will complete the following tasks:\n•\t Plan all work.\n•\t Set quality standards.\n•\t Report progress weekly.\nSee HEADINGS.\n\nLists\nShipley Proposal Guide\n147\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nPLACE THE NAME OF THE LIST IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE LIST.\nSometimes the introduction to items in the list becomes so \nlong that the reader forgets what was supposed to be in the list.\nNamed list with long setup (difficult to read)\nWhen initiated by a call to the Help Desk, actions taken by our service \ntechnician will include the following unless the service call is initiated \noutside our normal business hours, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, EST:\n•\t Review the service request.\n•\t Determine probable cause using our proprietary Dr. Bug™ \nsoftware.\n•\t Schedule service call with the initiator.\n•\t Make the call and fix the problem.\nNamed list with name before the list (easier to read)\nUnless the service call is initiated outside our normal business hours \n8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, EST, our service technician at the Help Desk will \ntake the following actions:\n•\t Review the service request.\n•\t Determine probable cause using our proprietary  \nDr. Bug™ software.\n•\t Schedule service call with the initiator.\n•\t Make the call and fix the problem.\nThe second is easier to understand because the named action \nimmediately precedes the list.\n4\t\nLIMIT LIST CONTENTS TO THE ITEMS NAMED.\nMany lists found in proposals are not the items named and not \nparallel in structure.\nOur project manager will complete the following tasks:\n•\t Plan all work.\n•\t Set quality standards.\n•\t Project managers cannot begin out-of-scope work unless ap-\nproved by Purchasing in writing.\nThe third item is not a task. Such explanatory detail should \nbe placed in a following sentence or omitted. Other lists are \nparallel in structure but do not contain the items named.\nOur solution offers the following benefits:\n•\t 24 x 7 service\n•\t ISO 9000 certification\n•\t Operational cost reductions\n•\t 99.92 percent availability\nThe first two items are features, the third is clearly a benefit, \nthe fourth is probably a benefit.\nCalling a feature a benefit suggests you do not understand \nyour customer’s needs and that you may be trying to sell them \nsomething that they do not need, thus increasing the cost. \nIncorrectly confusing features and benefits is a major problem \nin many proposals. \n\nLists\nShipley Proposal Guide\n148\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nLIMIT YOUR USE OF DISPLAY LISTS TO ITEMS DESERVING EMPHASIS. \nCustomers care about the benefits to them \nand their organization. In complex sales, \nfeatures are relatively less important. Notice \nhow features are emphasized over benefits:\nThe Endeavor is the ultimate in drones on the market today. Timber-\nLands can improve forest productivity and the efficiency of individual \nforesters with Airwind’s comprehensive solution. In the attached \nproposal, you will see the following products detailed:\n•\t Endeavor drone\n•\t Pilot training\n•\t Maintenance training\n•\t Spare parts\n•\t Radios\n•\t Transportation and packing\n•\t Disassembly/assembly approach\n•\t Maintenance support\n•\t Standard warranty\n•\t Manuals\nNotice how the benefit, improve forest production and the \nefficiency of individual foresters, is presented before the \nfeatures (good) but buried in the middle of the second \nsentence (poor). The list of features gets the most emphasis \nby being surrounded by white space. Skim readers may only \nsee the list of features. A more persuasive organization would \nbegin with the second sentence, bullet list the benefits, then \ndiscuss the benefits in order. The features should be aligned \nwith the appropriate benefit.\nSee PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT \nDESIGN.\n6\t\nMINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE CONFUSING NESTED LISTS.\nNested lists are lists within lists.

Follow that convention.\nUsing bullets, dashes, or similar nonordered marks does not \nmean items are of equal importance. If you want the reader to \nknow that all items are of equal importance, tell them.\n8\t\nCAPITALIZE THE FIRST WORD IN EACH ITEM. END ALL ITEMS WITH A PERIOD \nONLY IF AT LEAST ONE ITEM IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE.\nMany proposal writers incorrectly punctuate items in a display \nlist like items in a paragraph list. Do not place commas at the \nend of display list items or a period at the end of the last item \nin the list.\nIncorrectly punctuated display list (poor example)\nOur project manager will complete the following tasks:\n•\t  Plan all work,\n•\t Set quality standards, and\n•\t Report progress weekly.\nThe above style of punctuation in displayed lists is increasingly \nrare and outdated. Less than 10 percent of current editors \nretain this style.\nCorrectly punctuated display list (good example)\nOur project manager will complete the following tasks:\n•\t Plan all work\n•\t Set quality standards\n•\t Report progress weekly\nPunctuate a displayed list when the items in the list complete \nan introductory statement.\nCorrectly punctuated display list (good example)\nYou may identify potential boilerplate material for your proposal by\n1.\t Calling up the search screen,\n2.\t Entering a word or topic, followed by striking the return key, and \nthen\n3.\t Reviewing the potential material that appears in the next \nwindow.\nTraditional practice is to end all list items with a period only \nif at least one item is a complete sentence. This includes \nimperative commands when the first word is a verb and the \nnoun is understood.\nHowever, some editors recommend making all list items either \nphrases or complete sentences. Make your choice and be \nconsistent. \nMany more punctuation variations are possible than have \nbeen discussed in this Proposal Guide. If you need further \ndetail, refer to a writing style guide or manual of style.\n\nNumbering Systems\nShipley Proposal Guide\n150\n©Shipley Associates\nNUMBERING SYSTEMS\nIdeally, your numbering system takes the evaluator directly to \neach answer. The compromise on large proposals is to balance \nthe number of heading levels used with how closely the \nsubsection number takes the evaluator to each answer.\nThe two basic numbering systems are the traditional or \nalphanumeric system and the decimal system. \nTraditional System\nTraditional outlines use the following numbering and \n lettering conventions:\nI.\n  A.\n    1.\n       a.\n         (1)\n           (a)    \n               1)\n                 a)\nDecimal System\nIn the decimal system, successive decimal points indicate  \nlevels of subordination:\nNumbering systems are used with the table of contents, cross-reference matrix, and headings to show the proposal’s \norganization and allow evaluators to rapidly locate the answers to the questions asked in the bid request.\n 1.0\n     1.1\n        1.1.1\n        1.1.2\n        1.1.3\n            1.1.3.1\n            1.1.3.2\n2.0\n     2.1\n     2.2\n        2.2.1\n        2.2.2\nSome bid requests simply skip numbers, reserving a section in \ncase they need it later. Some place periods after the last num-\nber. Some drop in a letter when they want to use a single place \nand nine is not enough places. \nFor example, the author of a bid request wants bidders to \ndiscuss 11 items within section 3.2.4. Bidders may select any of \nthe three following numbering options:\n1\n2\n3\n3.2.4.1\n3.2.4.01\n3.2.4.a\n3.2.4.2\n3.2.4.02\n3.2.4.b\n3.2.4.9\n3.2.4.09\n3.2.4.i\n3.2.4.10\n3.2.4.10\n3.2.4.j\n3.2.4.11\n3.2.4.11\n3.2.4.k\nThe concern with approaches 1 or 2 is that someone will insert a \ndecimal point between the last two numbers. Assuming base-10 \nnumbering, a single space permits 1 through 9. When a bidder \nuses letters, 26 places are possible—A through Z. Using a blend \nof numbers and letters may prevent the problem.\n\nNumbering Systems\nShipley Proposal Guide\n151\n©Shipley Associates\nNo matter how poor the numbering system in the bid request, \nuse it. Imagine how difficult evaluation is when each bidding \ncompany invents its own system. Often the evaluator did not \nprepare the bid request. \nPlace helpful notes in your proposal and your cross-reference \nmatrix to make it easy for evaluators to correlate the bid \nrequest and your proposal. \nGood Examples\n2.3 Intentionally blank. This section was skipped in our proposal to \nmaintain identical section numbers between your RFP and  \nour proposal.\nOur proposal section numbers mirror the RFP section numbers  \nexcept the L.21 prefix on every number was dropped for simplicity. For \nexample:\nRFP Para. #            Proposal Para. #\n  L.21.1\t\n\t\n1.0\n  L.21.1.1\t \t\n1.1\n  L.21.3.3\t \t\n3.3\n  L.21.3.3.1\t\n3.3.1 \nMirror the numbering system of the bid request  \nwhen possible.\nIf given a choice, select the decimal system \nover the traditional system.\nLimit numbered subheadings to three levels \nplus an additional unnumbered sublevel, \nunless you are mirroring the bid request.\n3\nNUMBERING SYSTEMS\n1\n2\n1\t\nMIRROR THE NUMBERING SYSTEM OF THE BID REQUEST WHEN POSSIBLE. \nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS and \nOUTLINING.\n2\t\nIF GIVEN A CHOICE, SELECT THE DECIMAL SYSTEM OVER THE  \nTRADITIONAL SYSTEM.\nThe decimal system is instantly understandable. Three \nnumbers mean it is a third-level section. Additionally, the \nreader does not have to rebuild the real reference caused by an \na) that goes with a 1 that goes to an A two pages previous, etc.\nAssuming the traditional system, few readers instantly know \n“a” is a fourth-level heading—I.A.1.a.\nDo you ever find yourself or see others saying the alphabet t \no determine which letter comes next? That seldom happens \nwith numbers.\nWhile the convention is established, many potential readers \ndo not know the correct order for a., (a), or a). Also, while \nincreasing indentation at succeeding levels is most common \nfor traditional systems, it can leave unusually wide left margins \nwhen combined with multi-column page designs.\n\nNumbering Systems\nShipley Proposal Guide\n152\n©Shipley Associates\nUNNUMBERED SUBSECTIONS\nALL SUBSECTIONS NUMBERED\n3\t\nLIMIT NUMBERED SUBHEADINGS TO THREE LEVELS PLUS AN ADDITIONAL  \nUNNUMBERED SUBLEVEL, UNLESS YOU ARE MIRRORING THE BID REQUEST.\nThe greater the number of levels in the proposal, the harder \nit is to follow. If your numbering system can get the evaluator \nto within three pages or closer, your numbering system is \nprobably adequate.\nUse introductions and unnumbered or run-in subheadings to \ndirect evaluators within subsections longer than one page. \nEither of the following examples is acceptable.

While their original objectives remain, a \nkey additional objective is to meet, interview, and assess the \nproposed delivery team. While the written proposal qualifies \nthe selling organization, the oral proposal determines the \nwinner. \nPreviously, when a presentation followed a written proposal, \nthe team would focus first on the written document, then the \npresentation. \nNow, the timing and extent of the oral proposal and the \nwritten proposal, if any, vary. Often both must be prepared in \nparallel, requiring a different and potentially more demanding \npreparation process. Bid requests normally specify the time, \nlocation, presentation facilities, length of presentation, visual \naids, and who may present. \nNote that while the intent was to replace the written proposal \nwith an oral proposal, agencies frequently require both.\nOral proposals typically include the following sections:\n•\t Sample tasks and other tests\n•\t Requirements understanding\n•\t Capabilities\n•\t Approaches\n•\t Experience\n•\t Quality and transition plans\nOral proposals typically exclude the following sections:\n•\t Cost information\n•\t Representations and certifications\n•\t Personnel resumes\n•\t Performance history\n•\t Contractual commitments\nORAL PROPOSALS\nSee PRESENTATIONS \nTO CUSTOMERS,  \nCapture Guide.\nOral proposals are provided with or as a substitute for information typically provided in a traditional written proposal. Unlike \nmost oral sales presentations, the oral proposal is not a direct restatement of information in the written proposal.\n\nOral Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n154\n©Shipley Associates\nORAL PROPOSALS\nPrepare for an oral proposal by understanding the \nsimilarities and differences between written and oral \nproposals.\nDevelop a style that presents your nonverbal \nmessages so they reinforce your verbal messages.\nPlan your entire approach before preparing your \npresentation.\n1\n2\n3\nOrganize your presentation by using the Oral \nProposal Planner (OPP) to map content from the \nProposal Development Worksheet (PDW) into the \npresentation.\n4\nCreate effective visuals.\nRehearse early, realistically, and often.\nOrchestrate the entire presentation, \nincluding video.\n5\n6\n7\nPrepare a lessons-learned analysis to understand \nyour win or loss and to improve subsequent \nproposals.\n8\n1\t\nPREPARE FOR AN ORAL PROPOSAL BY UNDERSTANDING THE SIMILARITIES AND \nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN WRITTEN AND ORAL PROPOSALS.\nIt is critical to understand customer expectations for oral \nproposals or demonstrations. Many customers prefer video to \nbe part of the briefing or presentation.\nOral and written proposals have similar requirements:\n•\t Pre-positioning with the customer\n•\t Making a good bid decision\n•\t Understanding the audience\n•\t Complying with bid request instructions\n•\t Preparing a Proposal Management Plan\n•\t Preparing and conducting the kickoff meeting\n•\t Designing and implementing your strategy\n•\t Adhering to schedule\n•\t Storyboarding the proposal\nOral proposals have several fundamentally different \nrequirements:\n•\t Planning and developing written and oral proposals \nsimultaneously\n•\t Selecting, training, and rehearsing credible presenters\n•\t Designing fewer but more critical graphics\n•\t Rehearsing realistically\n•\t Preparing to handle extemporaneous questions\n•\t Preparing scripts and video (as required)\nInstructions for oral proposals vary by agency and \nprocurement official:\n•\t Delivery is at your site or theirs.\n•\t Delivery is recorded or live.\n•\t Written proposals, submitted prior to or at the \npresentation, may or may not be required.\n•\t Media, handouts, and props may be specified and limited.\n•\t Presentation materials are often limited and must be \nsubmitted in advance with no subsequent modifications.\n•\t Presentation time is usually limited and structured.\n•\t Presenters and their roles are often specified, especially \nwhen teams are being tested.\n\nOral Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n155\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nDEVELOP A STYLE THAT PRESENTS YOUR NONVERBAL MESSAGES SO THEY  \nREINFORCE YOUR VERBAL MESSAGES.\nNonverbal messages can reinforce, replace, or contradict the \nverbal message. Your goal should be to control your nonverbal \nmessages so that they reinforce your verbal message. \nReinforcing your verbal messages requires congruence of the \nverbal and nonverbal elements.\nThe verbal elements of a speaker’s message are the words. The \nnonverbal elements include visual and vocal cues. Visual cues \nare the way the speaker appears, stands, moves, gestures, and \nlooks at the audience. Vocal cues are the way the speaker says \nthe words.\nThe nonverbal aspects of oral communication are vital to \nbeing clear, credible, and persuasive. Nonverbal elements \naffect clarity because approximately 70 percent of the \ninformation absorbed in oral communication stems from the \nnonverbal elements.\nYour credibility is questioned when the verbal and nonverbal \nelements of your oral communication conflict. When this \nhappens, audience members are more likely to trust the \nnonverbal elements when they determine the meaning of the \nmessage.\nEffective persuasion is conservatively estimated to be \n50 percent facts and 50 percent emotion. Emotion in a \npresentation is conveyed primarily by nonverbal elements, as \nshown in figure 1.\nPresenters need to develop and display competent, acceptable \nnonverbal presentation skills. Evaluators do not expect stars. \nAssess the following nonverbal skills of your presenters and \nuse rehearsals to minimize their negative impact.\nFigure 1. Importance of Nonverbal Communication to Persuade. \nResearch by Dr. Albert Mehrabian at UCLA demonstrated the impor­\ntance of nonverbal communication to communicate emotion. He \ndetermined that 93 percent of the emo­tional content of a message is \nconveyed non­verbally by visual and vocal cues. \n7%\nVERBAL\n(the words used)\n55%\nVISUAL\n(gestures, \nmovement, \nexpression)\n38%\nVOCAL\n(HOW words \nare said)\nNONVERBAL\n\nOral Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n156\n©Shipley Associates\n1.\tEye contact is one of the best ways to hold a \nlistener’s attention. Use specific drills to accustom \npresenters to hold eye contact for three seconds with \nindividual audience members. \nTry this drill to improve a presenter’s eye contact with \nthe audience. Ask individuals in the audience to hold \ntheir hands up until the presenter has maintained \ncontinuous eye contact with them for three seconds. \nThe presenter’s objective is to get all hands down. \n2.\tFacial expressions must naturally reflect your \nmessage. Smiling does not detract from a serious \nmessage. Use rehearsals to eliminate inappropriate \nfacial expressions like frowns, sneers, or smirks.\n3.\tAppearance should be appropriate, neat, and \nsimilar among presenters but not necessarily \nidentical. Appropriate dress helps presenters feel \nconfident. \nAppropriate dress will depend on the country, \nculture, location, season, and industry. Try to \ndress slightly better than the audience. Groups of \npresenters should dress similarly, to look like a team, \nbut not identically unless uniforms are normal dress. \nDiscuss dress options during preparations, and \npreview all presenters’ dress at a dress rehearsal.\n4.\tPosture demonstrates confidence and self-esteem. \nGestures between the waist and shoulders are \nstrongest and project confidence. If using a podium, \nstand beside it, not behind it. Try to eliminate \nanything that blocks the audience’s view of the \nspeaker from the waist up.\n5.\tEnter and exit confidently. Movement draws the \neye of the audience and commands attention. \nUse movement to signal a change of topic. Move \ncloser to the audience when emphasizing a point or \naddressing a question.\n6.\tGestures are an extension of movement. Practice \ngesturing, not gestures. Gestures that are studied \nlook studied. Gestures will vary by presenter and will \nbecome more natural with rehearsal.  \nAudiences will accept a wide variety of speaking \nstyles. Your primary objective should be to coach \npresenters to eliminate distractive mannerisms, not \nto turn them into robots. \n7.\tVoice delivery, not the words, carries 38 percent of \nthe emotional impact. Vary voice volume, speed, \nand pitch. Pause for attention or emphasis. Enunciate \ncarefully, especially when discussing complex points. \nRepeat key or complex points.\nN O N V E R B A L  S K I L LS  G U I D E L I N E\n3\t\nPLAN YOUR ENTIRE APPROACH BEFORE PREPARING YOUR PRESENTATION.\nBoth oral and written proposals \nrequire careful planning before \npreparing the presentation or drafting \nsections. A unique aspect of oral \nproposal planning is assessing the \npresentation situation. \nVital aspects of the presentation \nsituation are the time, setting, \noccasion, and technology. \nTime aspects include the time allowed, the time of day, and \nthe order of presenters.\nRegarding the setting, determine the location and physical \nlayout of the room, the number of evaluators present, and the \nresources available.\nThe occasion requires that you understand the situation in \ncontext; what outside events could affect your presentation?\nThe technology required must be understood and tested to \navoid false starts or wasted time.\nCommon aspects to \nplanning oral and \nwritten proposals are \ncovered in greater \ndetail in the Proposal \nManagement Plan and \nare only briefly listed \nhere:\n•\t Analyze the bid \nrequest.\n•\t Create a compli-\nance checklist.\n•\t Complete the PDW.\n•\t Develop an annotat-\ned outline.\n\nOral Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n157\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nORGANIZE YOUR PRESENTATION BY USING THE ORAL PROPOSAL PLANNER (OPP) \nTO MAP CONTENT FROM THE PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET (PDW) \nINTO THE PRESENTATION.\nUse the OPP, shown in figure 3, to build a presentation that is \nlogical, responsive, consistent, and persuasive. Use the OPP to \nplan every major topic:\n•\t Identify the time allotted to the topic.\n•\t Identify applicable evaluation criteria.\n•\t Show how strategy will be implemented.\n•\t Structure topic introductions.\n•\t Develop content point-by-point.\n•\t Summarize key benefits and features.\n•\t Close with power.\nMap the content from the PDW to the OPP to save time and \nmaintain consistency. Data flows from the PDW, shown in \nfigure 2, to the OPP, shown in figure 3.\nIf no written proposal is required, you could begin with the \nOPP. However, content planning is not as thorough, and \nimportant points are easily missed.\nOrder your main points in the same order as they were listed \nin the bid request. If no order is specified, order them in \ndecreasing order of importance to the customer.\nUse the Triple-S presentation \nformula to present each main point:\n1. State\n\t\nMy first point is. . .\n\t\nMy second point is . . .\n2. Support\n\t\nLet’s define . . .\n\t\nWhat this means is . . .\n\t\nFor example, a previous client with. . .\n\t\nThe president of Acme said . . .\n\t\nImagine that . . .\n\t\nHere is a picture of . . .\n\t\nIndependent testers found that . . .\n3.

If you started with \na challenge, quotation, or surprising fact, close with it.\n5\t\nCREATE EFFECTIVE VISUALS.\nCarefully selected visuals have a powerful effect on evaluators. \nEffective visuals help them remember your key messages, \noften after a series of presentations given in one mind-\nnumbing day or several days apart.\nAccording to the Industrial Audio Visual Association, people \nremember what they see and hear better than if they learned \nin only one mode, as summarized in figure 4.\nFor guidelines on \ncreating proposal \nvisuals, see COLOR \nand GRAPHICS.\nAlways test visuals on the \nactual delivery media. \nColors may shift signifi-\ncantly in hue or intensity \nfrom computer monitor \nto projected image \nor printed document. \nProjectors also have \nvariations in color and \nbrightness depending on \nmodel and light or power \noutput.\nFigure 4.

Two to three  \nper minute is a maximum; add time if you need to \ncomment on them.\n2.\t Determine your key strategies and how you could  \ndepict each.\n3.\t Review the evaluation criteria and major issues; then \nbrainstorm what graphics tell compelling stories or offer \nproof of performance about each.\n4.\t Review your PDWs for useful graphics.\n5.\t Identify risks and visually depict risk mitigation \napproaches.\n6.\t Visualize ways to portray added value.\n7.\t Prioritize your visuals, one to three, low to high.\n8.\t Retain the threes and as many twos as you have time  \nto present.\n9.\t Review the sequential logic of your visuals. Remove or \nadd visuals as needed.\nUse the following guidelines to present effectively:\n•\t Check sight lines to ensure everyone can see.\n•\t Place the screen or monitor to one side of the room at a \n45-degree angle, space permitting.\n•\t Rehearse with your visuals and always talk to the \naudience, not the visual.\n•\t Use animation or progressive reveal to limit reading \nahead.\n•\t Summarize complex visuals; expand on simple visuals.\n•\t Test all hyperlinks to websites or video elements of your \npresentation.\n6\t\nREHEARSE EARLY, REALISTICALLY, AND OFTEN.\nCapitalize on your strengths and minimize your presentation \nweaknesses. Most of us are painfully aware of our weaknesses. \nExtensive practice with skilled coaching can make anyone \nmuch better.\nPractice individual parts of your presentation. Then rehearse the \nentire presentation before a live audience while you time it.\nPractice progressively. Initially, practice in nonthreatening \nsituations; then add peers, your boss, a final dress rehearsal, \nand record yourself.\nWhile most oral proposals do not specify a question/answer \nperiod, prepare for one anyway. Much of the real testing of a \nproposal team is during the question period.\nAnticipate tough questions; prepare your answers, and \nrehearse answering them. Handled properly, the question \nperiod is an important opportunity to reinforce key ideas, \nclarify points, establish a rapport with individual evaluators, \nand generally discriminate your team and offer.\nLearn a consistent method to address questions. Practice \nfollowing these guidelines:\n1.\t Respond to one question at a time.\n2.\t Listen to the full question carefully. \n3.\t Focus on the questioner:\n\t– Face the questioner.\n\t– Lean forward or move toward the questioner.\n\t– Establish eye contact.\n\t– Indicate active listening.\n4.\t Do not interrupt.\n5.\t Listen to the content (words) and for the intent (ultimate \npurpose) of the question.\nIf you do not know the answer, admit it or defer to someone \nelse on your team.\nEssentially similar to the State, Support, Summarize approach \nto present main points, follow these guidelines when \nanswering questions:\n1.\t Restate the question.\n2.\t Concisely state your summary answer.\n3.\t Support your answer.\n4.\t Summarize or restate your original answer.\n5.\t Ask if the questioner is satisfied.\nFor negative questions, do not restate the question. Agree with \nthe questioner if possible. Try to address the positive side of \nwhat has been done. \n\nOral Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n162\n©Shipley Associates\nAs part of your preparation, develop two or three specific Very \nImportant Points (VIPs). They usually flow from your strategy \nas expressed in your executive summary and are no more than \n20 seconds long.\nWhen you must deny an accusation, bridge or transition to \none of your VIPs. When questions are hostile, restrict negative, \nnonverbal language, such as touching your head or face or \nshifting your weight.\n7\t\nORCHESTRATE THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION, INCLUDING VIDEO.\nTry to control as much of your presentation as possible. \nAppoint one person to be a facilitator, much like an MC. \nPrepare backup materials and approaches. Anticipate what \ncould go wrong and devise a solution. Test all video aspects \nand any hyperlinks. Check that you have extra batteries for \nremotes or other electronics.\nPrepare handouts for distribution at the end, if permitted. \nRefer to them at the end, not the beginning. Offer electronic \ncopies when appropriate.\nA trend toward more video may require specialized resources \nto generate scripts, provide editing and create quality audio. \nKnow your customer’s expectations.\n8\t\nPREPARE A LESSONS-LEARNED ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WIN OR \nLOSS AND TO IMPROVE SUBSEQUENT PROPOSALS.\nAs with all proposal efforts, prepare a lessons-learned analysis \nafter each oral proposal. \nAsk each participant to submit a short self-assessment and \nteam assessment. Collect and combine them into a formal \nreport, and debrief the team so everyone learns from the \nexperience.\nRequest and attend a customer debrief as soon as the \ncustomer allows, win or lose. Summarize their comments in \nwriting, add it to your formal report, and pass appropriate \ncomments to presenters and contributors. \n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n163\n©Shipley Associates\nORGANIZATION\nLiterature is typically ordered as a narrative flow that is read \nfrom beginning to end. Business and technical documents, \nnewspapers, magazines, and professional journals are \nscanned, then referenced by readers searching for limited \ninformation at any one time. Readers’ primary requirements \nare to:\n•\t Immediately locate the information\n•\t Immediately comprehend the information\nEvaluators read proposals similarly. Few evaluators read \nthe entire proposal, and virtually no one reads the proposal \nsequentially, start-to-finish, like a novel. Instead, they search \nfor answers to a question, score the answer, justify their score, \nand then search for the answer to the next question. \nRecall the last time you lost something. Why do you always \nfind the item in the last place that you look? Because you stop \nlooking after you find it. Why would evaluators keep reading \nafter finding the answer?\nPrinciples of organization for proposals, business documents, \nand technical documents differ slightly from document \nto document. Variables include the type of document, the \nreaders, the evaluation or referencing process, the intellectual \ncontent of the document, and the writer’s purpose. \nAfter you review these guidelines, you will see many \nsimilarities among proposals and national and regional \nnewspapers and magazines. Most public media and websites \nare designed to be rapidly and flexibly accessed and easily \nunderstood by diverse readers.\nOrganization is the key writing principle for most business documents, including proposals. Sound, well-conceived organization \nwill make the actual writing easier, especially for writers with limited confidence in their writing skills. Nothing can save a poorly \norganized proposal.\nWell-organized proposals have common features:\nThey announce their \norganization and \nfollow it. \nKey points \nare clear and \nunderstandable \nfor the intended \nevaluators.\nThey are customer-\nfocused, conforming \nto the evaluators’ \nsense of what is \nimportant to them. \nThey use multiple \nstylistic devices to \nenable evaluators \nto access the \ndocument at random, \nquickly understand \nthe organization, \nand locate and \ncomprehend the \ninformation they \nneed.\n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n164\n©Shipley Associates\nORGANIZATION\nOrganize your proposal the way the customer \ntells you to organize it in the bid request.\nFollow a consistent process to think clearly \nand then write quickly and efficiently.\nOrganize information to make your \nproposal easy to evaluate.\n1\n2\n3\nKeep set-ups short.\nState your most important point first.\nAdjust the writing style and graphics in each section of \nthe proposal to the anticipated needs of the evaluator.\n6\n7\n8\nSummarize at all levels.\nGroup similar ideas.\n4\n5\nUse templates to help organize your \nmessages before drafting text.\n9\n1\t\nORGANIZE YOUR PROPOSAL THE WAY THE CUSTOMER TELLS YOU TO ORGANIZE \nIT IN THE BID REQUEST.\nMirroring the bid request’s organization in your proposal \nmight violate other recommendations in this Proposal Guide. \nHowever, your goal is to prepare an easily evaluated proposal, \nnot necessarily a logical one. \nEveryone’s logic varies. Imagine how difficult multiple \nproposals are to evaluate when each proposal follows the \nofferor’s unique logic.\nOften, evaluators do not prepare the bid request and are as \nfrustrated with the imposed organization as you are. Not \nfollowing the mandated organization \nonly increases their frustration and \npotentially lowers your score.\nYour top-level organization will vary depending on whether \nyou have a bid request with specific organizational \ninstructions, a bid request with no instructions, or an orally \nsolicited proposal with no written bid request.\nFor casually or informally requested proposals, discuss the \nproposal contents, size, and organization with the customer. \nUse closed rather than open questions in this discussion. \nSuggest broad guidelines, and then seek agreement.\nPoor questions\nWhat do you want included in the proposal?\nHow big should the proposal be?\nBetter questions\nLet’s discuss what information you will need to make a thorough \nanalysis and recommendation for management approval. As a start, I \nsuggest we include . . . Will that be sufficient?\nTo simplify your evaluation, I suggest we omit the typical corporate \nhistory and general technology descriptions and focus on the specific \nsolution, our project team, and key milestone schedule. We could \ncover that in a relatively compact 35-page proposal. Would that meet \nyour needs?\nIf a casually solicited proposal is competitive, your discussion \ngives you the edge over competitors that omit this step.\nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS and \nOUTLINING.\n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n165\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nFOLLOW A CONSISTENT PROCESS TO THINK CLEARLY AND THEN WRITE QUICKLY \nAND EFFICIENTLY.\nUse a step-by-step writing process to write both efficiently \nand effectively. Use the same approach each time you prepare \nany message, written or oral. You will spend less time figuring \nout what to do and have more time to prepare an effective \nmessage.\nMost writers have experienced writer’s block, when the ideas \nand words will not flow. Avoid or at least minimize writer’s \nblock by following this five-step POWeR™ writing process:\n\t P lanning\n\t O rganizing\n\t Writing \n\t e xamining\n\t R evising/Rehearsing \nThe acronym POWeR has four uppercase letters and a lower \ncase e. The uppercase letters represent stages or steps that \nthe author controls. The lowercase e represents the examining \nstage where other people are asked to suggest improvements \nbefore the message is revised.\nApply these sequential steps when \nyou prepare any kind of written or oral \nmessage. Substeps in each stage are \nsummarized in figure 1.\nPLANNING\n•\t Determine your objective (to do, know, and/or feel).\n•\t Analyze the prospective audience.\n•\t Analyze message content.\n•\t Select the optimal medium.\n•\t Develop content.\nORGANIZING\n•\t Structure your message as instructed by the customer.\n•\t Summarize, then support.\n•\t Use four-box organizational approach.\n•\t Determine what will be emphasized.\nWRITING\n•\t Draft.\n•\t Use emphasis techniques.\neXAMINING\n•\t Cool the draft.\n•\t Seek outside review (peers, managers, customer).\nREVISING OR REHEARSING\n•\t Make your message clear.\n•\t Make your message concise.\n•\t Make your message correct.\nFigure 1. Improve Communication Effectiveness and Efficiency \nby Using the POWeR™ Writing Process. This five-step process is an \neffective and efficient way to develop written and oral messages. This \napproach is implicit within the business development process and \ntools discussed in this Proposal Guide.\nThe POWeR process  \napplies equally well to \nwriting and presenting. \nFirst prepare your  \npresentation using the \nfive-step process and  \nadd Rehearsing to the \nrevising step.\n3\t\nORGANIZE INFORMATION TO MAKE YOUR PROPOSAL EASY TO EVALUATE.\nEvaluators scan, locate, read, and then comprehend. Make it \neasy for evaluators to find the answers to their questions and \neasy for them to give you a maximum score. \nScanners are attracted by the following emphasis devices:\n•\t Headings\n•\t Graphics (photo, sketch, chart, table)\n•\t Action captions attached to graphics\n•\t Color\n•\t White space\n•\t Larger, bold, or colorful print\n•\t Initial paragraphs\n•\t Bullet lists\n•\t Callouts\n•\t Headers and footers\nUse these emphasis devices alone or in combination. Here are \na few examples:\n•\t Group a series of answers in a table or matrix.\nOne evaluator said, “We went to the tables and graphics first. If \nwe found the answer, we didn’t have to read the text.”\n•\t Answer questions in informative headings.\nRequirement\nDOE must have unlimited rights of entry to all proposed sites \nduring the site survey period.\n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n166\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nSUMMARIZE AT ALL LEVELS. \nThe first sentence, paragraph, and page of your proposal are \nthe most important. The last sentence, paragraph, and page \nare potentially the second most important, but only if you \nassume evaluators will read them. When preparation time \nis limited, focus on the opening summary over the closing \nsummary.\nInexperienced writers often confuse summaries and \nintroductions. Summaries briefly restate your essential \nmessage. Introductions preview content and organization.\nOpening any portion of a proposal with an introduction \nto yourself and your organization implies that you and the \ncustomer have not met. Perhaps worse, if they stop reading \nafter the introduction, they will not get your key messages. \nInstead, combine the summary and introduction, beginning \nwith the summary. Place the introduction, preview, or an \ninformal table of contents immediately after the summary. \nIf the summary generates sufficient interest, the evaluator \nwill keep reading. However, they might opt to jump to a \nspecific topic. The introduction confirms that topic is included \nand tells them how to find it. Either way, you have met the \nevaluator’s needs.\nThe executive summary should open with your overriding \ntheme statement, stating the most important point you \nwant every evaluator to remember. \nFollow the theme statement with a \nstatement of the customer’s vision, \na link between the customer’s vision \nand immediate need, an overview of \nyour solution, and a statement of compliance, all within the \nfirst few paragraphs. \nEvaluators might quit reading at any time. Give evaluators \nyour most important points before they quit reading by \nsummarizing at all levels: the proposal, volume, section, \nsubsection, and paragraph.\nThe executive summary should summarize your entire \nproposal, and volume summaries should summarize each \nvolume. Open sections and subsections with a summary, and \nopen individual paragraphs with summary sentences.\nFinally, keep your word; maintain your credibility. If you \nintroduce a series of topics, discuss those topics in the order \nintroduced and name the topics identically, as shown in the \nfollowing proposal excerpt:\nIntroduction\nOur comprehensive solution incorporates a proven, COTS-based  \ndesign; low-risk implementation; and reliable, dedicated project team.\nSubheadings\nPoor Examples\nTechnical Solution \nManagement Approach\nBetter Examples\nDesign \nImplementation \nProject Team\nBest Examples\nProven, COTS-Based Design\nLow-Risk Implementation \nReliable, Dedicated Project Team\nSee EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.\nSee MODEL DOCUMENTS \nfor examples of executive \nsummaries.\nResponse\nAll Site Owners Agree to Unlimited Rights of Entry\nWe have obtained signed agreements from all twelve property \nowners within the proposed site indicating . . .\n•\t Include a compliance matrix at the beginning of the \nproposal and perhaps at the beginning of proposal \nsections. \nNot everyone enjoys reading proposals. You should not be too \nconcerned if they read every word of your proposal as long as \nthey give you the highest score and select your solution. \n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n167\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nGROUP SIMILAR IDEAS. \nSeparating similar ideas creates confusion and chaos. \nGrouping similar ideas in a proposal can be difficult:\n•\t Bid requests scatter similar questions.\n•\t Different questions require similar support.\n•\t Multiple authors are unaware of the overlap.\n•\t Authors draw answers from the same boilerplate \n(previously written materials).\nUse storyboards to help writers group similar ideas and to plan \nand review content before drafting. \nProposal managers have the primary duty to detect and \nresolve the inconsistencies and redundancies. Writers may \nalso detect them by reviewing section drafts. \nHow you deal with redundancies depends on the size of the \nproposal, RFP page limits, and the relative importance of the \nmaterials. Do not insult the intelligence of the evaluator by \ninserting identical text without an explanation.\nTo eliminate cross-referencing among volumes, repeat the \nanswer to the same question asked in different volumes. Tell \nthem that you repeated your answer:\nWe answered this question earlier in Volume 1, Section 1.2.3, and have \nrepeated it here for your convenience.\nCross-referencing within the same volume is generally \nacceptable. Answer the question fully the first time it is asked. \nThe next time the same question is asked, introduce your \nanswer as shown:\nWe answered this question earlier in Section 1.2.3 and have summa-\nrized our response here for your convenience. For detail, please refer \nto Section 1.2.3. \nWhen bid request instructions force you to scatter information, \nexploit this opportunity to demonstrate your customer-\nfocused approach:\n•\t Insert a brief summary.\n•\t Insert a brief introduction.\nWhile our flight test program will follow the low-cost, low-risk sequence \nof 1) laboratory tests, 2) ground tests, and then 3) flight tests, our \nresponse is ordered per your bid request instructions: \n1.\tFlight tests\n2.\tLaboratory tests\n3.\tGround tests\nSee STORYBOARDS \nAND MOCKUPS: \nCONTENT PLANNING \nTOOLS.\nSee MODEL DOCUMENTS \nand QUESTION/ \nRESPONSE PROPOSALS.\n6\t\nKEEP SET-UPS SHORT.\nSome documents need a short set-up to help the reader place \nthe document in the context of prior events. If so, keep your \nset-up short to get to your major ideas as rapidly as possible.\n1.\t Restate needs in your own words, while making the \ncustomer’s ownership of the problem specific, for \nexample: \nIn our meetings with your key managers over the past 3 months \nand in your RFP, you said that you needed to . . .\nAvoid copying and pasting text from the bid request.\nCopying and pasting pages or paragraphs from the bid \nrequest demonstrates that you can copy-and-paste but \nnot that you understand their problem. \t\n2.\t Begin with your value proposition or a benefit statement: \nCascadia Timber can reduce annual forest management costs by \n$1,000,000 annually by purchasing . . .\nAvoid beginning with a cliche. \nThank you for the opportunity to present our proposal for . . .\nWe are pleased to present our proposal for . . .\n3.\t Limit the set-up to a sentence or phrase:\nIn our meeting on April 15, you asked us to prepare a proposal \nsummarizing how…\nAvoid beginning by thoroughly summarizing prior events.\nIn 20XX, we began by . . . Then we . . . Over the subsequent 3 \nyears of the initial contract, we . . . Our extensive work culminat-\ned in your decision to request proposals from . . .\nGood proposal writers use a similar approach when discussing \npoor performance. Stress lessons learned from poor \nperformance and corrective actions taken. Carefully present, \nbut do not ignore negative information. \nThe first sentence links to the prior event. The second sentence \nbegins with positive information, positively states a rationale, \nand then delivers the bad news. The final sentence closes with \na positive statement to further soften the bad news and add \nperspective.\n\nOrganization\nShipley Proposal Guide\n168\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nSTATE YOUR MOST IMPORTANT POINT FIRST.\nIn a fast-paced business environment, readers value the result \nover the support. Managers usually value results over process. \nA Wall Street Journal study found that 10 percent of their \nreaders stopped reading after each column inch of copy. Six \ninches into a story, nearly one-half of the readers have quit \nreading.\nProposal evaluators have a similar reading pattern; they read \nuntil satisfied, score the question, then look for the answer to \nthe next question.\nMost writers write like the documents they \nread. Technical people tend to use a technical \nor scientific format. Scientists know that a result is useless \nunless the proper process was carefully documented so it can \nbe followed by others to verify results. Hence, in the scientific \nformat, process is more important than the result and comes \nfirst in the document.\nProposal writers with technical backgrounds tend to lead to, \nrather than from, major ideas. Such writers build their case \nlogically, fearing skeptical evaluators will not believe them \nunless they build their case.\nMost newspapers, magazines, blog posts, and professional \nbusiness documents use managerial, or top-down, \norganization. They state their conclusion or result, and then \nsupport it. Proposal writers should do the same.\nWhen writing any proposal or business document, ask \nyourself, “If the evaluator or reader stopped reading at any \ntime, have I placed my ideas or points in decreasing order \nof importance to the reader?” If not, reorder them. Put the \n“Bottom Line Up Front” (BLUF).\nSee LISTS.\n8\t\nADJUST THE WRITING STYLE AND GRAPHICS IN EACH SECTION OF THE  \nPROPOSAL TO THE ANTICIPATED NEEDS OF THE EVALUATOR. \nChoose graphics and a style of writing appropriate to the \nevaluators of each section of the proposal. For example, all \nevaluators, including nontechnical ones, must understand \nexecutive summary graphics. \nHighly technical proposal \nsections can contain more \ncomplex, technical graphics, but \nonly include sufficient technical \ndetail to make them correct. \nAdjust your style of writing \nsimilarly. Larger paragraphs, \nsentences, and words are \nacceptable in more technical proposal sections. However, \nproposals are not technical treatises. Evaluators often perceive \noverly technical writing and graphics as technical arrogance.\nWithin a proposal and within proposal sections, you can \nincrease the technical complexity. Begin sections with \nsuccinct, clear summaries that are broadly understandable. \nThen, increase the complexity as needed to satisfy the more \ntechnical evaluators. The less technical evaluators will have \nquit reading and jumped to the next section.\nApply this guideline to both graphics and text. \nWhen incorporating boiler-\nplate or reusing material \nin your proposal, update \nsummaries, introductions, and \nsubheadings. First, tailor the \nsummary to this competition. \nNext, if you add or delete top-\nics, reflect those changes in \nthe introduction. Then, order \nthe topics in decreasing order \nof importance to this customer \non this opportunity.\n9\t\nUSE TEMPLATES TO HELP ORGANIZE YOUR MESSAGES BEFORE DRAFTING TEXT. \nUse templates customized for the type of document being \nwritten to encourage writers to follow a process. \nWhen asked to write, most people think about drafting text. \nYou will produce more successful documents if you follow a \nconsistent writing process like POWeR™ and use customized \ntemplates.\nWhen confronted with different templates, remember that \nfollowing the process is more important than the exact \ncontent, form, or format of the template.\nThe Shipley Capture Guide contains examples of the templates \nlisted in figure 2. \nThe Four-Box Template shown in figure 3 is the fundamental \ndocument organizer.

Apply this organizational structure to virtually any type of business document.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n170\n©Shipley Associates\nOUTLINING\nOutlines are important in individual \nproposal writing efforts and \nessential in team writing efforts. \nThe outline establishes the table \nof contents, serves as a proposal \nmanagement tool, and helps writers \nsee their task as it relates to the \nentire proposal.\nGuidelines for developing sound proposal outlines are \nbased on the principles of customer focus and organization. \nBy following customers’ instructions and organization, no \nmatter how illogical, you demonstrate that you listen to \nyour customers and give them exactly what they request. By \nfollowing sound document organizational guidelines, you \ndemonstrate your ability to meet the customer’s needs in an \neasy-to-understand and convincing fashion.\nDeveloping a compliant outline is often difficult. Nearly every \nbid request is confusing on the first reading. The difficulty \nincreases with complex and poorly written bid requests, \nmanagement pressures to start writing immediately, and \nindividual pressure to use a different outline because it is more \nlogical or better matches something already written.\nOutlining is a crucial proposal management activity. All subsequent work is based on the initial outline. \nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS,  \nCUSTOMER FOCUS, \nHEADINGS, NUMBERING \nSYSTEMS, ORGANIZATION, \nPROPOSAL MANAGEMENT \nPLAN, and STORYBOARDS \nAND MOCKUPS: CONTENT \nPLANNING TOOLS.\nOUTLINING\nDevelop your proposal outline as the customer \nsuggests, either in the bid request or verbally.\nPrepare a top-level, topical outline that follows the \ncustomer’s organizational priority. \nAssign or allocate all other response \nrequirements within the topical outline.\n1\n2\n3\nDevelop outlines for unsolicited proposals (1) \ncollaboratively with your customer, (2) based on \ndiscussion with your customer, or (3) logically.\nAnnotate outlines as needed to guide writers.\nExtend your outline into a Proposal Responsibility \nMatrix to help manage the proposal.\n6\n7\n8\nUse informative headings at section levels \nbelow those specified by the customer.\nAllocate pages according to the relative \nimportance of the topic to the customer.\n4\n5\nWhen you have to deviate from the bid request, \nalways explain your deviation to the evaluator.\n9\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n171\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nDEVELOP YOUR PROPOSAL OUTLINE AS THE CUSTOMER SUGGESTS, EITHER IN \nTHE BID REQUEST OR VERBALLY.\nFirst, follow the customer’s proposal organization instructions \nprecisely, even if they seem illogical. Then, apply sound \norganizational principles at succeeding levels. \nCustomers frequently direct or at least suggest how offerors’ \nproposals should be organized. A common organization helps \nevaluators assess competing proposals.\nDetailed proposal preparation instructions are required for \nU.S. federal bid requests issued under the Federal Acquisition \nRegulations, FAR Part 15. The FAR requires the bid request \nstructure shown in figure 1, with Instructions to Offerors in \nsection L. \nInternational, central, regional, and local government agencies \nof all types often include a less-detailed set of instructions on \nhow to organize your proposal. Large companies that routinely \ncompete in these market sectors tend to follow similar \nproposal solicitation procedures. \nThe lack of organizational instructions usually reflects a \nlack of established purchasing procedures or experience on \nthe part of the people requesting the proposal. Treat this \nas an opportunity to favorably influence the bid request by \ncollaboratively developing the proposal requirements and \noutline with the customer.\nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS.\nRFP\nDESCRIPTION\nTYPICAL CONTENT\nA\nSolicitation/Contract form \nRFP table of contents, contact information, due date, submittal location; serves \nas contract when signed by offeror and government\nB\nSupplies or services and prices/costs\nContract Line Items (CLINs) listing what is to be priced and how\nC\nDescription/Specifications/Statement of work \nDescribes work required, i.e., specification\nD\nPackaging and marking \nProduct packaging and markings required\nE\nInspection and acceptance \nProduct/service inspection and acceptance criteria\nF\nDeliveries or performance \nWhen products or services are required\nG\nContract administration data \nContract requirements not on solicitation form\nH\nSpecial contract requirements \nItems not in Section I or other sections of the contract\nI\nContract clauses \nClauses required by law or included in contract\nJ\nList of attachments \nData requirements and organization, anything that did not fit elsewhere, and \noccasionally organizational instructions not included in Section L to permit using \nan otherwise standard RFP\nK\nRepresentations, certifications, and other \nstatements of offerors or respondents \nAcknowledgment forms that must be signed and submitted with the proposal\nL\nInstructions, conditions, and notices to  \nofferors or respondents\nInstructions for proposal preparation, format, organization, content, length\nM\nEvaluation factors for award \nProcess, evaluation factors, and relative importance of the factors used to \nevaluate offers\nFigure 1. How U.S. Federal Bid Requests Are Organized. FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, prescribes this bid request structure for ma-\njor competitive and negotiated procurements to simplify proposal preparation for offerors and to improve proposal evaluation by government \nsource selection teams.\nIf you have a bid request with no instructions on how to \norganize your proposal, mirror the organization of the bid \nrequest as closely as possible. Number, order, and name \nsections as was done in the bid request. When all else fails, \nmake an assumption, state it clearly, and continue proposal \ndevelopment.\nState your assumptions explaining \nhow your proposal is organized in your \ncompliance matrix, table of contents, and \nintroductions at relevant levels. This style \nchoice conveys a helpful, reader-friendly tone.\nSee NUMBERING \nSYSTEMS and \nSTYLE AND TONE.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n172\n©Shipley Associates\nThe following two examples show how organizational \nassumptions can be stated in both formal and question-and-\nresponse bid requests:\nAssumption stated in the contents and/or response matrix \nAll proposal instructions were followed explicitly. Our numbering \nsystem is identical to bid request Section L. Other requirements were \ninserted within the L dictated outline where they were most rele-\nvant. All responses to bid request requirements can be located in the \nResponse Matrix.\nAssumption for a non-federal question and response style\nAll sections of the bid request, and all questions with multiple parts \nwere answered in the order asked. Short summaries at the beginning \nof major sections establish perspective.\n2\t\nPREPARE A TOP-LEVEL, TOPICAL OUTLINE THAT FOLLOWS THE CUSTOMER’S  \nORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITY. \nMany bid requests are written by different people, with \ndifferent knowledge and interests, over months or years. \nFollow the organizational priority set by those who manage \nthe evaluation process. \nFor a U.S. federal bid request, develop your outline based on \nthe following organizational priority:\n1.\t\nSection L: Instructions, conditions, notices\n2.\t\nSection M: Evaluation factors\n3.\t\nSection C: Statement of Work\n4.\t\nSection B: Supplies or services and prices/costs\n5.\t\nAll other sections\nThese recommendations are consistent among proposal \nprofessionals and based on who has control of the evaluation \nprocess. Different sections are often written by different \ntypes of people. L is prepared by the people running the \nprocurement. M is prepared by the group making the selection \ndecision. C is written by the people who understand the \nservices or products or by their consultants, as much as 3 to 5 \nyears earlier. They may or may not be users of the services or \nproducts. B is prepared by an \naccounting or financial person. \nFor all other written bid requests, look for similar instructions: \n•\t Organizational instructions \n•\t Evaluation criteria or hot buttons \n•\t Statement of Work tasks \n•\t Separately priced items or tasks \nTo emphasize compliance, retain and extend the numbering \nsystem used in the bid request. \nKeep identical naming conventions. Capitalize the same \nwords, hyphenate the same words, and spell them the same \nunless the word is misspelled.\nMaintain the same order as listed in the bid request, even if the \norder is not logical to you.\nFigure 2 shows how a top-level, topical outline is prepared \nfrom a bid request excerpt typical of any market sector. The bid \nrequest directly indicates the numbered, second-level topics, \ne.g., 2.1 Organization Structure and Facility Resources. \nAdding the third- and fourth-level subsections depends on \ntheir page length. Generally, use a subsection number if the \nlength exceeds two pages. Note the lower-level topics are \nincluded as unnumbered items but would not be listed in the \ntable of contents. \nOn a large proposal effort \nor on a complex proposal, \nprepare a first- and \nsecond-level outline first \nand get consensus among \nmanagement and key team \nmembers. Then create a third- \nor fourth-level outline and try \nto keep it there. Avoid further \nsubstantial changes.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n173\n©Shipley Associates\nR F P  E X C E R P T\n2.0 Management Plan\n1. Organization Structure and Facility Resources.

Mimic the numbering system, naming conventions, and order of the topics listed in the bid \nrequest. Use the exact wording and naming conventions to simplify the evaluator’s search for wording or topics in your proposal. The items \nlisted under 2.2.1.1 are shown to illustrate subsection content under each project description but would not be included in the topical outline or \ntable of contents.\n3\t\nASSIGN OR ALLOCATE ALL OTHER RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE  \nTOPICAL OUTLINE.\nAfter placing all response requirements embedded within \nthe proposal instructions in your outline, you must assign or \nallocate all other requirements within the same topical outline. \nAugmenting the original topical outline with additional \nsubsections and requirements is more difficult when different \nbid request sections have different structures.\nA single-level bid request, like the example in figure 2, is \nrelatively simple to outline. Multilevel bid requests are more \ncomplex. \nMultilevel bid requests have the organization and \nrequirements established at the top level plus additional \noverlapping requirements at one or more lower levels.\nMultilevel bid requests are similar to a couple purchasing a \nhouse. Each partner establishes his or her own requirements; \nsome are the same, some are unique, and some conflict. \nFigure 3 illustrates how additional bid request sections other \nthan the proposal instructions are incorporated into the \nproposal outline. Because there is no single correct answer, \nyour compliance or response matrix becomes even more \nimportant.\nWhen you extend the topical outline, aim for balance. For \nexample, if you go only to 2.1 in one section, try to avoid \ngoing to 2.2.X.X in another section. Such differences imply an \nunbalanced response.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n174\n©Shipley Associates\nA common approach is to develop the topical outline, and \nthen instruct all contributors to “Read the bid request, identify \nthe additional requirements relevant to your section, and \naddress each one in your draft.” The results are orphans that \nno one addresses and redundancies that several people \naddress differently. Making the problem worse, redundant \nitems may be double costed.\nB I D  R E Q U E S T  E X C E R P T :  S T A T E M E N T  O F  W O R K\n5.2  Management Reporting.

The SOW further references zoning regulation in paragraph \n5.3, which are excerpted in orange type. The colored text shows how the additional requirements are folded into the proposal outline. The alter-\nnate approaches show two acceptable ways the outline could be prepared, depending on the length of each subsection.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n175\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nUSE INFORMATIVE HEADINGS AT SECTION LEVELS BELOW THOSE SPECIFIED BY \nTHE CUSTOMER.\nInformative headings can impart a positive message. In the \nexample shown in figures 2 and 3, the headings in black are \nall telegraphic and identical to the bid request. Some of the \nheadings in blue and orange can be improved by making them \ninformative:\nTelegraphic heading\n•\t Project Team Structure\n•\t Project Team Management\n•\t Fire Protection Plan\n•\t Seismic Protection Plan\nInformative Heading\n•\t Proven Team Structure Reduces Risk\n•\t Responsive Team Management Improves Service\n•\t Proactive Fire Risk Management Cuts Loss\n•\t Earthquake Preparedness Is a Priority\nAvoid combining theme statements and informative headings. \nThese combinations are cumbersome and repetitive.\nSee HEADINGS. \n5\t\nALLOCATE PAGES ACCORDING TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF  \nTHE TOPIC TO THE CUSTOMER.\nAllocate pages based on the page limitations or \nrecommendations in the bid request or suggestions from the \ncustomer. If none are given, attempt to discover the customer’s \nexpectations through a collaborative discussion. Attempt to \nreduce page-length expectations to optimize preparation time \nand cost unless a shorter proposal conflicts with your proposal \nstrategy.\nAfter determining or estimating the total page count, allocate \npages according to the relative importance to the customer, \ntempered by your proposal strategy.  \nDetermine relative importance based on the following \nindicators, in the order listed:\n1.\t Evaluation criteria\n2.\t Discussion with the customer\n3.\t Judgment\nOften, evaluation criteria are both broadly stated and stated \nin order of relative importance. Use your judgment to allocate \nthe page count among the first-level topical outline, then \nextend your allocation to subsections until all contributors \nhave a clear page limit or guideline for their assigned sections. \nThe approach is shown in figures 4 and 5.\nRFP Instructions to Offerors\nAll proposals are limited to 100 pages, excluding preface pages. Attachments are not included nor are they encouraged. \nAll proposals should contain the following sections:\n1.\t System Hardware—Describe all hardware that will be supplied and how it connects with existing hardware. Include appropriate \nsystem diagrams.\n2.\t System and Network Software—Indicate the software to be supplied, its capabilities, upgradability, and warranty.\n3.\t Project Management—Indicate how the project will be managed, naming all proposed personnel judged key to this project’s \nsuccess. Include a first- and second-tier schedule that links to your proposed WBS and SOW. For all personnel, indicate the \npercentage of their time devoted to this project.\n4.\t Training—Include a training plan for all operators and maintenance technicians. Indicate the additional support available and its \ncost.\n5.\t Pricing—Include a complete pricing breakdown of all hardware, software, and services identified in the SOW. \nEvaluation Criteria\nProposals that fail to respond fully to all requirements as listed may be rejected without further consideration. Selection will be based \non the evaluation team’s judgment of the offer that affords the best value. The following evaluation factors are listed in decreasing \norder of importance:  (1) Technical, (2) Management, (3) Cost.\nIn the Technical area, hardware is one-half as important as software but twice as important as training.\nFigure 4.

Refer to previous proposals deemed acceptable by the \ncustomer, customer file notes, and intelligence resources.\nPrepare a response checklist.\nIn some instances, this checklist may become the basis for a \ncompetitive bid. If so, you have influenced the requirements, \ngiving yourself an advantage.\nFollow these steps:\n1.\t List the requirements as you understand them.\n2.\t Verify your list and add requirements as you discover \nthem in face-to-face meetings and phone calls.\n3.\t Prioritize your list by categories.\n4.\t Seek final customer buy-off via a read-through when \npossible.\n5.\t Submit a copy of the final requirements checklist along \nwith your proposal.\n\nOutlining\nShipley Proposal Guide\n177\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nANNOTATE OUTLINES AS NEEDED TO GUIDE WRITERS.\nIf you want writers to include certain information, use \na specific example, follow a set strategy, or tell them by \nannotating the proposal outline. Too frequently, proposal \nmanagers ask writers, “Why didn’t you discuss the ABC \nProject?”  The usual answer, “You didn’t tell me to,” or, “I didn’t \nknow about it.”\nAvoid rework by annotating your proposal outlines with as \nmuch important detail as possible. \n8\t\nEXTEND YOUR OUTLINE INTO A PROPOSAL RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX TO HELP \nMANAGE THE PROPOSAL.\nExtend your proposal outline into a Proposal Responsibility \nMatrix. Most proposal managers use a spreadsheet program, \nenabling them to add columns to track additional tasks \nassociated with the development of \neach proposal section in the outline. \nAn example is shown in figure 6.\nSection \nNumber\nSection Heading (Title)\nPage \nAlloc.\nAuthor\nStoryboard \nDue\nMockup Due\nPink Team \nDate\nRed Team \nDate\nFinal \nApproval\nRemarks\nM\nExecutive Summary\n4.\nS.

Sometimes called a Proposal Status Tracker, proposal managers use it to manage and monitor the \nstatus of each section assigned to each writer. Using spreadsheet software, add a row for each task and a column for each milestone. Keep a \nversion prominently displayed in the proposal room and review progress in daily stand-up meetings.\n9\t\nWHEN YOU HAVE TO DEVIATE FROM THE BID REQUEST, ALWAYS EXPLAIN  \nYOUR DEVIATION TO THE EVALUATOR.\nWhen you are deviating from the bid request or you do \nnot understand the customer’s intent, insert explanatory \ncomments, like those listed below. \nAt the beginning of compliance matrix\nOur proposal mirrors your bid request organization and numbering \nsystem. The L.21 prefix was dropped for all proposal section numbers.\nIn a cost or price volume\nAll items costed correspond with tasks described in our technical \nvolume.\nThis page is intentionally blank.\nSection number x.x.x was intentionally skipped to maintain agree-\nment with the bid request. \nThis stylistic choice signals your desire to make things easier \nfor the evaluator and suggests that your organization will be \neasier to work with if you win the contract.\nAt a proposal debriefing, the buyer said, “It was like you were \nreading our mind. We found 80 percent of the answers where \nwe expected to find them.” If 80 percent is mind reading, \nimagine what evaluators normally face. \nExplanatory comments are in \naddition to always including a \ncompliance or response matrix \nin every proposal. For unsolicited \nproposals, consider adding a \ntopic index, directing evaluators \nto all significant topics.\nThe Proposal \nResponsibility Matrix, \nshown in figure 6, is \nalso discussed in DAILY \nPROPOSAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n178\n©Shipley Associates\nPAGE AND DOCUMENT DESIGN\nThe reading process is identical \nfor technical documentation or a \nproposal. However, the motivation \nof the reader differs. The more \ninteresting the subject to the \nreader, the more the reader wants \nthe information, and the less you \nhave to entice the reader to read \nyour document. How interested \nand motivated are evaluators in \nreading your proposal?\nPeople are lookers first, then readers. A good page \nand document design entices readers, then facilitates \nunderstanding, even though evaluators may not be conscious \nof the design techniques used. A well-organized, visually \nappealing design helps evaluators find what they need to \nknow rapidly and easily while reflecting your organization’s \nprofessionalism.\nNever underestimate the importance of the proposal’s \nappearance. When competitors’ offers differ minimally, the \nappearance and organization of the proposal can make the \ndifference. \nSee your proposal in its totality. The best proposals are \na sequence of integrated impressions that are planned, \ncoherent, and repeated to produce the strongest impact on \nevaluators. A well-designed proposal eases the evaluator’s \njob. Visual elements entice readers: the organization is easy to \nfollow, answers are easy to find, key points stand out, graphics \nare clear and conveniently placed, and the text is easy to read.\nYour document and page design should consider the following \nelements:\n•\t Page format\n•\t Type size and font\n•\t Color\n•\t Covers and binding system, if required\n•\t Graphics type, size, style, and quantity\n•\t Production requirements\nMany proposal professionals cite the bid request warning, \n“Overly elaborate proposals may indicate the offeror’s lack of \ncost consciousness,” as a justification for dull, plain proposals. \nWith the cost of a computer, software, and an inexpensive \ncolor printer, intelligent, attractive page and document design \nis not expensive.\nThe greater danger is to use a page and document design that \nsuggests your organization is out-of-date. Claims of leading-\nedge technology and world-class products and services cannot \ncounter a visually outdated proposal. However, artificial \nvariety and inconsistent devices can be distracting, confusing, \nand off-putting.\nPage and document design impact whether your proposal is read, how it is read, and whether it is remembered. The physical \ndesign of your proposal pages emphasizes or de-emphasizes your messages much like body language, word dynamics, and \nfacial expressions in conversation.\nThe proposal might be the \nfirst deliverable that your \ncustomer receives from you.\nResist excessive emphasis \ndevices that make \nyour proposal busy, \ncluttered, confusing, \nor unprofessional. The \nransom note look is not \nprofessional.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n179\n©Shipley Associates\nPAGE AND DOCUMENT DESIGN\nFollow the customer’s page and document \ndesign instructions.\nUse a template for every proposal.\nSelect a document and page style appropriate \nto your customer’s organization, your \nindustry, and your organization.\n1\n2\n3\nAdapt your layout to the structure of the writing.\n4\nSelect a page-column design that balances page \nlimits, production requirements, readability, and \ngraphics size flexibility.\nSelect complementary font styles, \nsizes, and leading.\nEstablish a consistent system for headings, \nthemes, action captions, lists, and other page \ndesign features.\n7\n8\n9\nChoose and place graphics for maximum impact \nand readability.\n10\nUse white space to guide the evaluator and to \nemphasize key points.\n5\nUse headers and footers to help evaluators navigate \nyour proposal while maintaining customer focus.\n6\nAvoid overusing emphasis devices.\n11\nUse left-justified text.\n12\n1\t\nFOLLOW THE CUSTOMER’S PAGE AND DOCUMENT DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS.\nSome bidders disagree with the instructions because they \ndon’t fit their process or they feel their approach is better. \nConsider the following examples.\nA major computer company, highly regarded for its sales training, \nhad training materials that said, “Our proposals should include these \nsections: . . .” and included a fixed list of topics. No mention was made \nto first follow each customer’s proposal instructions. How could they \nclaim to be customer-focused while ignoring the customer’s proposal \ninstructions?\nBidders trying to get around page limitations used foldout pages. \nSubsequent bid request instructions were amended to count any \npage larger than 8.5\" x 11\" as two pages.\nFollow preparation instructions precisely. Ask for clarification if \nneeded. Bid request preparation is often rushed, and mistakes \nare common. Customers are not trying to trick bidders.\nConsider submitting a sample page for approval. The worst \npossible result is that the customer refuses to answer.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n180\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nUSE A TEMPLATE FOR EVERY PROPOSAL.\nTemplates are essential, and they reduce preparation time. \nWhether you have single or multiple contributors, using a \ntemplate will give the proposal a consistent appearance, \nmaking it easier to evaluate.\nA good template both shows and tells writers the page layout; \nfont choice, point size, and line spacing for body text and \ngraphics text; and the colors to use. Figure 1 shows a template \nfor a full-column page design with various sized boxes reserved \nfor themes, callouts, and small graphics.\nEstablish an electronic template in the software of choice, and \nlimit the physical template, like the one in figure 1, to a single \npage or two. Many writers tend to ignore longer templates. \nA frequent practice on proposals with multiple writers and a \nproduction support group is to give each writer a simplified \ntemplate either at the kickoff meeting, via email, or over your \nintranet site. This simplified version is easier for writers to use \nand cuts the time spent on formatting.\nTemplates reduce production time and enhance flexibility. For \nexample, if all body text carries the same, defined style, then a \nsingle template change flows consistently through the entire \ndocument.\nProduction members generally strip out formatting before \nimposing their more complex template, to prevent importing \nextraneous or conflicting styles. You can eliminate this step if you \nhave a good template and if contributors know how to use it.\nRegardless of deliverable format, some veteran proposal \nmanagers prefer to complete the proposal using their \npreferred layout software, then convert it to the customer’s \nrequired format at the end. If you adopt this approach, test the \nconversion to verify it works.\nFigure 1. Establish a Template for Every Proposal. Good templates \nboth show and tell writers how proposal pages will look. They define \nthe fonts, point size, color, and spacing for all text and graphics. \nSimple visual templates, like the one shown, help writers visualize the \nappearance of their draft.\n3\t\nSELECT A DOCUMENT AND PAGE STYLE APPROPRIATE TO YOUR CUSTOMER’S \nORGANIZATION, YOUR INDUSTRY, AND YOUR ORGANIZATION.\nDocument style refers to the overall look and binding, or \npackaging, of the proposal. Page style refers to the size and \norientation of the elements on individual proposal pages.\nDesign tools will not make most of us designers. Good design \nis context-specific. Often, balanced order is simply boring while \nasymmetrical designs are dynamic, active, and expressive. \nHave a professional develop one or two quality, standard \nproposal designs. Reassess those designs every 2 or 3 years. \nThen, use the specific design most appropriate to each \ncompetition.\nProposal managers often think that competitors’ proposals \nlook much like their own proposals. Package your proposal \nto make it easy to identify, and design it to make it easy to \nevaluate while supporting your overall strategy.\nConsider these examples to broaden your perspective:\nThe executive summary for a proposal to a rental car company was \nprepared to mimic the customer’s folders used at pickup counters.\nA cost volume, full of large spreadsheets, was presented in landscape \nformat to better fit the typical spreadsheet layout.\nA company competing to supply business software development \nservices to a pizza chain delivered its proposals in the same boxes the \ncustomer used to deliver pizzas. \nA woman was applying for a position as editor of the employee \nnewsletter for a large, health care chain. Structuring her resume in a \nnewsletter format to demonstrate her capability got her an interview.\n \nVolume I: Technical \n \n \n20 \nX.X.X.X \nHeading 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n•  \n \n•  \n \n•  \n \n•  \nFigure X.

North America uses a page standard \nof 8.5\" x 11\", often packaged in three-ring binders. Europe and \nmuch of the rest of the world use the A4 size (a metric standard \nof 210mm x 297mm, or 8.268\" x 11.693\"), packaged in four-ring \nbinders. Getting the size wrong tends to emphasize a foreign \norigin and a potential lack of compatibility.\nDifferent packaging systems afford different cover art options. \nRing binders offer a spine that can display titles, art, and text—\nfeatures not possible with other types of binding systems. \nHowever, ring binders are difficult to store in filing cabinets, \nand pages can be removed or shuffled. \nRing binders are one of the easiest systems for rapid page \nchanges during production. Conversely, one contractor noted \nthat they did not use ring binders because they could be \nchanged by customers. \nYour packaging should be inviting and attractive to prompt \nthe customer to read your proposal. Consider how proposals \nwill be handled. Some packaging systems will look better than \nothers after extensive handling. \nAlso consider how your document will look if it is being \nsubmitted online. This may impact how you style elements like \nmargins, colors, and headers.\nOne non-government evaluator described how packaging \ninfluenced the selection decision for a $50,000 branch store \ncomputer system:\nI had 15 proposals and little time to evaluate. One cover caught my \nattention, and I remembered that the account representative for that \norganization was competent. I opened their executive summary and \nfound the price was within my budget. I gave them the contract. I had \nno requirement to open the other 14 proposals.\nUnless your proposal has \nfewer than 20 pages, use \ndouble-sided printing. \nThinner proposals are \nless daunting to evaluate, \nand graphics are easier to \nintegrate on the same page \nor a facing page.\nMinimize foldouts unless \nthey are required for larger \ngraphics or response \nmatrices, like the one \nshown in figure 2. Large \ngraphics requiring foldouts \ninclude wiring diagrams, schedules, and \nsome personnel charts. \nFigure 2. Using Foldouts for a Response Matrix. The response ma-\ntrix shown, placed at the front of a binder, has the matrix on the back \nside of the foldout that extends beyond the normal page. Evaluators \ncan turn proposal pages without obscuring the response matrix. \nSimilar response matrices can be placed in the back of the binder, but \nsome evaluators miss them, even when referenced.\nThe person in the production man-\nagement role should build a list to \ndocument all style decisions. Most \nare common to all proposals, but \nsome are unique to each proposal.\nCreative proposal packaging and \nsubmittal activities might appear \nto be “cute” or artificial. However, \ncustomers are usually more receptive \nto creative packaging than some con-\nservative members of the bid team. \nCarefully consider the customer’s \nlikely reaction. Use sound judgment. \nSlick packaging with weak content \nwill reduce your win probability.\n4\t\nADAPT YOUR LAYOUT TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE WRITING.\nThe need to make your proposal easy to evaluate and \nunderstand overrides other demands. Your design must both \nhelp and encourage the evaluator to enthusiastically score \nyour proposal higher than other proposals. Consider adapting \nyour layout to mirror the intellectual structure of your writing, \nas summarized in figure 3. However, the customer’s page \nrestrictions may also dictate adjustments to your desired \nstructure.\nNearly all of the Model Documents in this Proposal Guide \nreflect the four-box, intellectual organizational model \npresented in a complementary page design. Review Model \nDocuments for further examples of how to adapt page layout \nto the intellectual structure of the writing.\nSee GRAPHICS  \nand RESUMES.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n182\n©Shipley Associates\nFigure 3.

Using white space to \nemphasize and link points is like using a spotlight to highlight \na performer on stage. Two principles are involved: \n1.\tEmphasis—The more white space around a page \nelement, the greater the emphasis.\n2.\tAssociation—Readers visually link page elements that \nare grouped together.\nPage elements include text, paragraphs, headings, bullet lists, \ntables, graphics, and even the edge of the page. Using white \nspace for emphasis in lists is illustrated in figure 4. \nV E R S I O N  A\nV E R S I O N  B\nV E R S I O N  C\nV E R S I O N  D\nIn the attached proposal, you will see the following \nproducts detailed: Endeavor drones, operator \ntraining, maintenance training, spare parts, radios.\nIn the attached proposal, you will see the following \nproducts detailed:\n•\t Endeavor drones\n•\t Operator training\n•\t Maintenance training\n•\t Spare parts\n•\t Radios\nIn the attached proposal, you will see the following \nproducts detailed:\n•\t Endeavor drones\n•\t Pilot training\n•\t Maintenance training\n•\t Spare parts\n•\t Radios\nIn the attached proposal, you will see the following \nproducts detailed:\n•\t Endeavor drones\n•\t Operator training\n•\t Maintenance training\n•\t Spare parts\n•\t Radios\nFigure 4. Using White Space for Emphasis. White space is used to emphasize a graphical element. This series of examples shows how increas-\ning white space around the bullet list increases emphasis and thus, memorability. All versions are acceptable.\nLet in some air. Cramming as much as possible onto every \npage repels readers. Lighten your pages and attract readers \nby framing page elements in white space. A narrow 1/8\" frame \ncan make a huge difference. The wider the frame, the greater \nthe emphasis. \nLeaving open space at the top, bottom, or side of a page helps \nattract readers. Once you have attracted the reader, use as \nmuch text as needed. The most valuable parts of the page \nare the top and left side. Use them to first attract readers, and \nthen to convey key points.\nFigure 5 illustrates the visual association of page elements \napplied to both headings with text and graphics with captions.\nMany of the decisions about how different page elements \nrelate are implicit in the template and are not evident to \nproposal writers. Even with a good template, use desktop \npublishing assistance to produce a professional proposal that \nreflects your professional capabilities.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n184\n©Shipley Associates\nHEADING\nFigure x. Action Caption Title. Text text text.\nHEADING\nFigure x. Action Caption Title. Text text text.\nHEADING 2\nFigure 5. Using White Space to Associate Page Elements. Readers can more easily track through a document when related elements are visu-\nally associated. Headings should be closer to the following text than any other visual element. Captions should be closer to the related graphic \nthan any other visual element. In the poor example, the heading is closer to the top edge of the page than the relevant text, and the caption is \nequidistant between the graphic and the text.\n6\t\nUSE HEADERS AND FOOTERS TO HELP EVALUATORS NAVIGATE YOUR PROPOSAL \nWHILE MAINTAINING CUSTOMER FOCUS.\nEvaluators would like to be able \nto open a proposal at random, \npage backward or forward to a \nmajor section heading, and readily \nunderstand where they are in the \ndocument. For maximum focus on \nthe customer, place the following information in the header: \n•\t Customer name and logo (left)\n•\t Procurement name and number (right)\nPlace the following information in the footer:\n•\t Offeror’s name and logo (if allowed)\n•\t Volume and page number \n•\t Nondisclosure and proprietary statement references\n•\tWin theme, slogan, or tag line\n•\tSection name and number\n•\tDate submitted\n•\tDraft or final\nWith this much potential information, headers and footers \ncan become cluttered. Group information, leaving more of the \nmargins empty. Keep information in the same place, especially \nthe parts that change, like page numbers and section names \nand numbers.\nUse color, font style, and size to emphasize the most important \ninformation, while minimizing less important items like \nnondisclosure statements. \nWith double-sided printing, you can make right- and left-hand \npages identical or make them mirror images. Identical right \nand left pages simplify adding or removing pages, reducing \nproduction time. \nIn Western cultures, we read from top to bottom, left to right. \nMake the top rule heavier than the bottom rule to draw the eye \nto the top of the page. The rule is the line running across the \npage from margin to margin. \nNondisclosure and  \nproprietary statements \nare typically placed at the \nbeginning of the proposal, \nthen referred to in the \nfooter.\nCheck your printer to be \nsure your pages print \nfully. Many printers clasp \nthe paper at the top \nor bottom, potentially \ncutting off page numbers \nplaced too near the edge.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n185\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nSELECT A PAGE-COLUMN DESIGN THAT BALANCES PAGE LIMITS, PRODUCTION \nREQUIREMENTS, READABILITY, AND GRAPHICS SIZE FLEXIBILITY.\nMost proposal pages are designed with an underlying grid \npattern, most frequently one to four columns. Figure 6 \nillustrates some of the typical grid arrangements. Note that a \nfour-column design does not necessarily mean there are four \ncolumns of text. \nMultiple columns offer more flexibility in page layout and \nmake reading easier. Column-width should reflect the size of \ntype within the column. Narrow columns are best filled with \nsmall type, wider columns with bigger type. Readability study \nresults suggest limiting lines of text to 45 to 65 characters. If \nyou are using a 10-point serif font, that means your columns \nshould be no wider than about four inches. While influenced \nby font choice and leading (spacing between lines of text) \nreaders tend to lose their place when text lines get too long in \nproportion to type-size. \nIncreasing the number of \ncolumns appears to waste space \ndue to the gutter (the white space \nbetween columns). However, \nthe space lost for the gutter is \nmore than offset by the space \ngained at the end of paragraphs \nand between paragraphs. In \nboth cases, the loss is across a \nsingle column rather than the entire page. Depending upon \nthe exact layout, converting single- to two-column layout can \naccommodate up to 18 percent more words per page. As you \nadd columns, the additional words gained per page decreases \nand page layout effort increases. However, keep paragraphs \nshort when using multiple columns because most readers \nignore paragraphs longer than a few lines. \nSee ELECTRONIC SUBMITTAL \nfor guidelines on proposals \nthat will be viewed and  \nevaluated on-screen.\nGood page design encourages \nreading. In contrast, contracts \nare often written in long lines \nof fine, closely spaced print to \ndiscourage reading.\nSingle-Column Format. \nTypical for cover letters \nand simple proposals. \nEasy to do.\nTwo-Column Grid. Typical for \npage-limited proposals. Harder \nto do with word processing \nthan page-layout software.\nThree-Column Grid. \nOften used for proposals \nwhere page count is not \nlimited.\nFour-Column Grid. Also \nused for proposals \nwhere page count is not \nlimited.\nAsymmetrical Single-Column. These designs are based on an \nunderlying three- or four-column grid with text appearing as a \nsingle column. This design is recommended for non-page-limited \nproposals. Although it requires a more sophisticated style sheet or \ntemplate, this design is actually quite easy to execute in word \nprocessing packages. When using word processing packages, \nbegin by establishing a single-column with a wide left margin. Use \nframes or text blocks to place text or graphics in the left column.\nMultiple-Column Grid. Both examples show the flexibility \nof a multiple-grid page design. Visuals can be placed across \none to four columns as appropriate. Note how the \n“mountain” graphic was  placed incorrectly, potentially \nconfusing readers. A better placement would be at the \nbottom of grid column two or four to eliminate potential \nconfusion about which text to read next.\nFigure 6. Using Underlying Grid Patterns to Design Pages. Using multiple columns in your page design increases both flexibility and  \ncomplexity. The leading approaches are a single-column or two-column format for page-limited proposals and a one-third/two-thirds  \nasymmetrical style format using a three- or four-column grid for proposals without page limits. Place graphics toward the edges of pages to \navoid confusing reading patterns that unnecessarily interrupt columns of text.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n186\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nSELECT COMPLEMENTARY FONT STYLES, SIZES, AND LEADING.\nFonts or typefaces are divided into two broad groups, serif and \nsans serif. Serif is usually more compact, has feet or flared ends \non the type, and is typically used for body text in documents. \nSerif is easier to read en masse.\nLimit a document to two fonts unless a \ntrained designer recommends otherwise. \nInstead, exploit the variations of styles \nwithin the font, such as narrow, normal, \nitalic, and bold. When you must submit \nboth paper and electronic proposals, use the same fonts for \nboth versions.\nIn addition to serif and sans serif fonts, you will see script, \nsymbol, and display fonts. \n•\t Script fonts look like handwriting. \n•\t Symbol fonts include characters and shapes not found in \ntraditional alphabets and are used for emphasis, bullet \npoints, and decorations. \n•\t Display fonts are more distinct and often suggest an era  \nor theme. \nExcepting bullet points, use all three sparingly in proposals. \nUse simple circles or squares for bullet points. Complex \nsymbols and shapes are often distracting, and thin line weights \ndisappear when projected.\nDesigners can have strong opinions about fonts. The following \nare only guidelines to help those without design background \nwho do their own proposals:\n•\t Avoid ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. They are harder to read.\n•\t Use bold text for emphasis rather than underlining. \nUnderlining is harder to read and looks outdated.\n•\t Avoid overusing bold or any other emphasis \ntechnique. Too much emphasis means no emphasis.\n•\t Use italics for lighter emphasis than bold, but limit use to \nshort pieces of text or quotes. Long passages of italic text \nare harder to read than normal text. \n•\t Use italics to quote the customer’s bid request. \nReadability is less important, and italic type suggests a \nquote, which it is.\nType must be large enough to be \ncomfortably read. Use 10- to 12-point \nfonts, depending on a number  \nof factors:\n•\t Font choice—Fonts differ in width and x-height, x-height \nbeing literally the height of an x in the font. Ten-point \nin one font may be nearly as easy to read as 12-point in \nanother font.\n•\t Printer and paper quality—Printers with a higher dot per \ninch (dpi) capability and coated paper will render clearer \nprint, making smaller letters legible. \n•\t Copying—If your printed proposal is photocopied or if \nyour customer is likely to photocopy your proposal, use \nlarger type.\n•\t Older readers—Many readers appreciate the readability \nof larger type.\n•\t Line length and leading—The longer the lines of text and \nthe narrower the leading or spacing between lines of \ntype, the larger the font required to maintain readability.\nWith more customers requiring electronic versions of \nproposals, select commonly available fonts that are identical \nacross all platforms. Inappropriate font substitutions can \nruin the look of your proposal. Embed fonts in the files when \nsubmitting electronic proposals.\nGenerally, a safe choice for the proposal body text is 12-point \nin a font like Times New Roman or 10-point in a serif font with \na larger x-height.\nIf you share your document or presentation with others \nelectronically, stick with standard fonts to avoid display \nproblems. When in doubt, embed the fonts within the file. If \nyou get an error message, replace the fonts and try again. \nIn general, TrueType and OpenType fonts are compatible \nwithin Microsoft® Windows-based applications. Safe fonts for \nboth Macintosh® and Windows platforms are: Arial, Courier, \nGeorgia, Helvetica, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, \nand Verdana.\nSubmit PDF files to \neliminate potentially \nawkward font  \nsubstitutions and \npage breaks.\n9\t\nESTABLISH A CONSISTENT SYSTEM FOR HEADINGS, THEMES, ACTION CAPTIONS, \nLISTS, AND OTHER PAGE DESIGN FEATURES.\nProposal headings divide and label content, helping \nevaluators find answers to their questions. Frequent headings \nat multiple levels help evaluators quickly find information of \ninterest without having to read large blocks of text. Frustrated \nand confused evaluators give lower scores.\nWhere possible, use informative rather than tele­graphic \nheadings to convey a more complete message. \nAs part of your template, establish a consistent system for \nheadings, themes, action captions, and lists that includes font, \n“Point” is a measure of \nletter height, with 72 \npoints per inch; 72-point \ntext is 1-inch high.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n187\n©Shipley Associates\n10\t CHOOSE AND PLACE GRAPHICS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT AND READABILITY.\nUse graphics to help evaluators remember your main points. \nSize graphics to reflect their intellectual and visual value. A tiny \ngraphic can make a medium-sized graphic appear enormous \nand even more significant. Color in the graphic and white \nspace around a graphic increase its emphasis.\nSelect an appropriate type of graphic \nto support your strategy and key point. \nToo many proposal writers use a graphic \nsimply because it is available or because \nit is the only type of graphic they know \nhow to create. \nConsider the following contrasting guidelines:\nUse a chart or graph when \nemphasizing relationships or trends. \nUse a table when the absolute values \nof the numbers are important.\nUse a photograph to show that \nsomething is real, that it exists. Use a \nsketch or line drawing to emphasize \nspecific details. Photographs show \neverything, and often the details of \ninterest are not as easy to see.\nUse display lists for greater emphasis. \nUse paragraph lists when the items \nare not as important.\n1 Create outline following instructions\n2\nAugment basic outline with additional \ntopics from Evaluation Criteria\n4\nComplete outline with topics \nextracted from other sections of RFP\n3 Incorporate topics to cover the SOW\ntype style, type size, color, placement, and other emphasis \ndevices, such as borders or shading.\nEvaluators may not read all theme statements, but they \nnearly always read headings. The longer the theme statement \nand the more theme statements included in a proposal, the \nless likely they are to be read. Consider replacing theme \nstatements at lower section levels with informative headings. \nToo many proposal writers use long theme statements, short \nheadings, and short captions. Strive for the opposite. \nBe cautious about using shades of color to emphasize text. As \nthe contrast between the text and the color diminishes, the \ntext becomes much harder to read. \nMany copiers and some printers print colors differently, either \nfading out or becoming much darker than intended. Check \nyour printer or copier output. Also consider whether customer \ncopying of your proposal will add to the problem.\nBe particularly cautious when using a dark background with \nreverse print. Dark backgrounds tend to swallow light print, \nrequiring a larger and bolder font and type style. \nPrint on photographs may be hard to read. Both regular and \nreverse-print become illegible as photograph colors change. \nPlace print on a white background to improve print clarity.\nQuality and style criteria for headings, themes, action captions, \nand lists should extend beyond appearance to include content. \nEvaluators make negative inferences when emphasized items \noffer no discriminating content. \nKeep the following suggestions in mind when placing graphics \nin your proposal:\n•\t Introduce the graphic in body text before it appears  \nin the proposal. \n•\t Orient graphics vertically to the text so that evaluators do \nnot have to rotate the page.\n•\t Integrate the graphic so the evaluator can see the graphic \nwithout turning the page.\n•\t Ensure evaluators can get the point you intended by \nattaching an action caption to every graphic. Captions \nare the most important text on the page because readers’ \ncuriosity is piqued by the graphic.\nSee ELECTRONIC \nSUBMITTAL,  ACTION \nCAPTIONS, HEAD-\nINGS, LISTS, THEME \nSTATEMENTS, and \nGRAPHICS.\n\nPage and Document Design\nShipley Proposal Guide\n188\n©Shipley Associates\n•\t Observe the 10-Second Rule: Readers must be able to get \nyour point within 10 seconds. If they cannot, consider \ndividing the single graphic into several graphics.\n•\t Some complex technical graphics will not meet the \n10-Second Rule. Strive to make technical graphics as clear \nas possible. Consider adding more information to the \ncaptions of complex technical graphics.\n•\t Emphasize the right points. All but the simplest graphics \nshould have a fore-, middle-, and background to make \nthe graphic easy to interpret. Use line widths, color, and \nshading to differentiate the separate graphic elements. \n•\t Remove anything in your graphic that does not contribute \nto your point. \n•\t Avoid wrapping text around graphics. Uneven margins are \nparticularly hard to read.\nIn addition to the recommendations offered, consider the \nfollowing observations gleaned from reviewing hundreds of \nsales documents:\n•\t Many U.S. federal proposals contain graphics that  \nare too complex.\n•\t Too few proposal graphics have captions; those that do \nare generally too short.\n•\t Sales professionals who would refuse to make a \npresentation from slides that contain only text seem \nperfectly happy to give customers non-proposal sales \ndocuments devoid of graphics.\n•\t Proposals, other than for large, custom bid requests, \ntend to contain graphics that feature logos (the only color \nused), and tables and spreadsheets (the only type of \ngraphic the writer knew how to prepare).\n•\t Organizations should focus more on developing boilerplate \ngraphics and less on developing boilerplate text.\n•\t Boilerplate, both text and graphics, is generally  \nused poorly. \nBe sure all graphic files are \nincluded when submitting an \nelectronic proposal. Otherwise \ngraphics might display poorly or \nnot at all. Certain programs will \nnot open until the appropriate \ngraphic links are located.\nTo eliminate the possibility \nof missing or substituted \nfonts and graphics, create a \nPDF file of your document for \nsubmission. A PDF will con-\ntain all the elements of your \ndocument in a self-contained \nfile. You can touch up any \nspacing problems or missing \ngraphics using the complete \nversion of Adobe® Acrobat® \nsoftware.\nSee ORGANIZATION and \nGRAPHICS.\n11\t AVOID OVERUSING EMPHASIS DEVICES.\nToo much emphasis is no emphasis. Too many different \nemphasis devices are confusing and distracting. \nWhite space at the end of a column or page is a desirable \nemphasis device. Filling white space with relatively \nunimportant points detracts from key prior points. \nEmphasize the points most important to your customers, and \ntie these points to the most important reasons for them to \nselect your solution and your organization. Avoid emphasizing \nrelatively minor points.\n12\t USE LEFT-JUSTIFIED TEXT.\nUse left-justified text rather than full-justified text. Full \njustification has several undesirable attributes:\n•\t Uneven spacing between words and letters creates more \neye fatigue and may distract readers from your message. \nReaders sometimes pause on a poorly spaced word and \nthink, That word looks funny. I wonder if it’s misspelled?\n•\t Uniform line endings increase the probability that  \nreaders may accidentally skip a line or reread the same \nline of text.\nBoth of these problems interfere with the clear \nflow of information to the customer.\nLeft-justified text with ragged-right line endings \noffers several advantages:\n•\t Text is more readable.\n•\t Words and letters are spaced more evenly.\n•\t Gutters (space between columns) appear wider.\n•\t Pages of multi-column text are more varied, interesting, \nand appealing.\nUsing left- \njustified text is a \nrecommendation, \nnot a rule.\n\nPhotographs\nShipley Proposal Guide\n189\n©Shipley Associates\nUse a photograph to show only what exists. Use a sketch or \nillustration to show what is possible or to emphasize a specific \nfeature in isolation. \nTypically, too few photographs are used in proposals. \nPhotographs can be expensive, but hours of graphic artists’ \ntime can be even more expensive. Worse yet, engineers’ \ndrawings of marginal quality are even more costly, but none \nare as costly as lost orders due to boring, dense, text-heavy \nproposals.\nThese guidelines suggest ways to use photographs more \neffectively in sales documents. Techniques to either take or \ncompose photographs are left to other sources. \nPHOTOGRAPHS\nPhotographs convey realism and authenticity. Readers tend to trust photographs. However, with the ease of photo editing, \nevaluators are more skeptical than before.\nPHOTOGRAPHS\nVisualize what your customer wants to see; then \nselect images that support that vision.\nSelect photographs that support your \noverall strategy.\nObey copyright laws.\n1\n2\n3\nGo digital and use the resolution \nappropriate to the finished size.\nUse color to add realism, add information, \nand increase interest.\nEstablish the size, scale, and orientation of \nobjects in the photograph.\n6\n7\n8\nCollect photographs throughout the entire \nsales process.\n4\nDevelop a searchable and retrievable boilerplate \nphotographic and graphics library.\n9\nUse customers’ existing or past clients’ \nphotographs.\n5\n\nPhotographs\nShipley Proposal Guide\n190\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nVISUALIZE WHAT YOUR CUSTOMER WANTS TO SEE; THEN SELECT IMAGES THAT \nSUPPORT THAT VISION.\nVisualize the benefits your solution offers. Then plan or select \nphotographs that make the benefits seem real. The reality of a \nphotograph emotionally reinforces your message and implies \na lower risk. Imagine what the customer wants to see after \nmaking a purchase, as discussed in these examples:\nA customer selecting a design-build contractor \nfor a distribution center wants to see pho-\ntographs of a similar, complete distribution \ncenter with a caption citing success measures.\nParents selecting schools for their children want to see photographs \nof happy students; clean, bright classrooms; caring teachers; and \nelated graduates.\nWhen the sales approach extends beyond citing features to \nstressing benefits, service and product sales are identical. Both \nproducts and services enable the customer to do or experience \nsomething different and presumably better. Skilled marketers \nsell benefits. Select photographs for your proposals that do the \nsame.\nSee GRAPHICS for \na further discussion \nof how benefits are \nvisualized.\n2\t\nSELECT PHOTOGRAPHS THAT SUPPORT YOUR OVERALL STRATEGY.\nCustomers make or justify their selection \ndecisions by identifying differences in offers \nthat relate directly to their issues. \nPortray these differences, your \ndiscriminators, and directly tie them to the customers’ issues. \nState these differences and issues, using customers’ words.\nFor example, if a customer is worried about whether you can \ndo what you say, then your strategy could be to emphasize \nyour experience. A visual showing you doing what you propose \nfor another organization would emphasize your experience. A \nquote from the satisfied client would bolster your claim.\nFigure 1 offers an extended example of using photographs to \nsupport a bidder’s strategy. The competition was to prequalify \nonly two organizations to provide $500 million annually in \nconstruction services. The customer listed three hot buttons in \nits bid request:\n•\t Reduce capital cost\n•\t Reduce cycle time from inception to production\n•\t Streamline project planning\nThe winning two-page executive summary included two small \nphotographs to support the first and third hot buttons. The \nphotographs and quotes have been slightly altered to protect \nconfidentiality.\nNote how the first hot button, reduce capital cost, is directly \nsupported at the end of the Drugs-R-Us quote, . . . and \nsignificantly under budget. The third hot button, . . . streamline \nproject planning, is supported by the statement, In 6 months \nyour team is 2 months ahead of schedule . . . \nSometimes you may not be able to get a photo of the actual \nobject. One solution is to create a high-quality graphic or scale \nmodel. Then photograph the graphic or model to make the \nconceptual item look and feel more real to the evaluator. \nScale models or prototypes have been used for \ndemonstrations for years. Including photographs of a \nprototype in the proposal permits the evaluator to view the \nprototype that they cannot view live. \nDo not misrepresent photographs of graphics or prototypes \nas real. If the customer feels you are being deceptive, you lose \nyour credibility, the sale, and often subsequent sales. \nSee \nDISCRIMINATORS \nand PROPOSAL \nSTRATEGY.\n\nPhotographs\nShipley Proposal Guide\n191\n©Shipley Associates\n“In 10 years of doing projects throughout the U.S. and Europe, this has \nbeen the best so far. The Global Constructors difference is the people—\nuniquely qualified, energetic, and team oriented—they consistently \nexceeded my expectations and completed the project ahead of \nschedule, with outstanding quality, and significantly under budget.”\nDrugs-R-Us, Corporate Headquarters\n“Trying to describe what your Global team has accomplished \nduring the past 6 months is difficult. Words such as astounding and \nastonishing are insufficient. In 6 months your team is 2 months ahead \nof schedule, under budget, achieved a perfect safety record, and the \nquality of construction work is outstanding.”\nWorld Chemicals Health, Division Laboratory \nFigure 1. Using Photographs That Support Your Strategy. The photographs and client quotes were selected to reinforce the seller’s ability to \naddress the customer’s issues of reduced capital cost, reduced cycle time, and streamlined project planning. \n3\t\nOBEY COPYRIGHT LAWS.\nLegally, you cannot use an image unless you have permission \nfrom the owner. Copyright law declares that once someone \ncreates an image, the owner has rights to the image. \nIf you are using images from the customer’s website or another \nmedium, obtain permission before integrating those images \ninto your proposal. The same applies to any images obtained \nfrom an outside source: obtain permission prior to use.\n4\t\nCOLLECT PHOTOGRAPHS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SALES PROCESS.\nWhen you have to write the proposal, you seldom have time to \ngo back and take photographs. Collect them throughout the \nsales process.\nSales and service people, site managers, and project managers \nshould travel with a digital camera or photo-capable phone. \nObserve customer or client restrictions. Even when the inner \nfacilities are proprietary, you can often take photos of the \noutside or perhaps the sign at the front gate.\nPhotos taken during demonstrations or site visits either \nremind the evaluator of the experience or reinforce that \nmembers of their organization have seen proof of your \nperformance. \nTo broaden your vision of possible photographs, consider \nthese examples:\n•\t Photos of stages of facility construction enrich a project  \nschedule.\n•\t Photos of implementation enrich a transition plan.\n•\t Group photos of proposed individuals support claims of  \nteaming experience.\n•\t Adjacent before-and-after photos emphasize change.\n•\t Photos of your own facilities emphasize capacity and \nready capability.\n\nPhotographs\nShipley Proposal Guide\n192\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nUSE CUSTOMERS’ AND EXISTING OR PAST CLIENTS’ PHOTOGRAPHS.\nPhotos collected from the customer or taken at the customer’s \nfacilities demonstrate client focus. \nMany photos are directly available from an organization’s \nmarketing, public relations, or investor relations departments. \nWebsites are another source, although the resolution is \nusually limited. \nGather copies of customers’ and clients’ annual reports, \nmarketing brochures, and employee newsletters. Observe \nrestrictions on the rights to reuse or change the photos.\n6\t\nGO DIGITAL AND USE THE RESOLUTION APPROPRIATE TO THE FINISHED SIZE. \nWriters without skilled \npublishing support often \ninsert digital photos but \nare disappointed with the \npoor quality. To increase your success, observe the following \nguidelines:\n•\t Web photos and graphics typically have a 72 dpi (dots per \ninch) resolution, marginal in a printed document. Use 72 \ndpi photos at their actual size or smaller. \n•\t The maximum acceptable enlargement for any digital \nphoto is about 20 percent before the print becomes too \ngrainy.\n•\t Aim for 150 dpi when printing on typical office laser or \nink jet printers. Higher resolutions increase file sizes with \nminimal increases in print quality.\n•\t The minimum acceptable dpi resolution for offset printing \nis 300 dpi. Figure 2 compares the various file sizes for a \nsingle 3\" x 5\" scanned photo using different resolutions, \nfile formats, and degrees of compression. Multiple photos \ncreate immense files. Printers generally require TIFF, EPS, \nor PNG file formats.\n•\t When submitting electronic proposals, embed RGB \ngraphics for on-screen viewing.\n•\t When printing proposals, convert the RGB files to CMYK \n(Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black) or scan directly in CMYK for \ntruer color print quality. Print a trial version before full \nproduction to ensure the color on your computer screen \nmatches the printed color.\nObserve all copyright restrictions and licensing agreements \nwhen using stock photos, scanned photos, or photos taken \nfrom the Internet. Rules vary widely.\nNote that PNG files are the most \ncompact file format with excellent \nquality, and GIF is the poorest \nquality.\nSCANNED RESOLUTION\n300 DPI\n600 DPI\nFile Type\nJPG\nJPG\nTIF\nJPG\nJPG\nTIF\nCompression\nnone\nmed\nnone\nnone\nmed\nnone\nFile Size       \n2.5MB\n370KB\n4.1MB\n9.5MB\n1.3MB\n16.5MB\nFigure 2. Scanned Files Can Be Large. A 3\" x 5\" scanned photo resulted in file sizes of 370KB to 16.5MB. Variables were scanning resolution, \ndegree of compression, and file format.\n7\t\nUSE COLOR TO ADD REALISM, ADD INFORMATION, AND INCREASE INTEREST.\nThe highest-value places to use color are in your executive \nsummary and in emphasizing your discriminators in the \nproposal.\nToo often proposals simply use color where color is convenient \nfor the writer and production people. Typical but poor uses \nfor color are the seller’s logo, the customer’s logo, and header \nand footer lines. When these design elements get the greatest \nemphasis, you de-emphasize your strategy and discriminators.\nMake a black and white copy \nof color art. If you cannot read \nit, revise your color scheme to \nincrease the contrast between \ncolors.\nSee COLOR.\n\nPhotographs\nShipley Proposal Guide\n193\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nESTABLISH THE SIZE, SCALE, AND ORIENTATION OF OBJECTS IN  \nTHE PHOTOGRAPH.\nWhen the size, scale, or orientation of a photo or graphic is not \nobvious, include rulers, a human hand, or common objects. A \ncar key, coin, coffee cup, or a person will establish scale. \nUse arrows to establish orientation, linear movement, or \nrotation.\n9\t\nDEVELOP A SEARCHABLE AND RETRIEVABLE BOILERPLATE PHOTOGRAPHIC  \nAND GRAPHICS LIBRARY.\nThe greater effectiveness and higher cost of photographs when \ncompared to text suggest that more organizations should \ndevelop a boilerplate photographic and graphics library. \nFor each photograph, collect relevant information and sample \naction captions. As with other boilerplate materials, assign \nsomeone to verify that materials remain valid.\nAnother best practice is to attach a unique tracking number to \neach photo or graphic, including the revision number or date \nwhen appropriate. As in figure 3, print the tracking number \nwith the photo in the proposal to facilitate rapid retrieval for \nsubsequent proposals. \nFigure 3. Assign Graphic Tracking Numbers.

The U.S. \ngovernment defines cost and pricing data as all facts at the \ntime of agreement on price that can be expected to affect price \nnegotiations significantly.\nIf cost and pricing data are not disclosed, the government \ncan adjust the price. Price adjustments seldom happen in the \ncontractor’s favor. \nOften, governments get so much cost and pricing data that \nno one but specialist cost analysts look at it. This creates an \nopportunity for bidders to gain a competitive advantage by \npresenting their cost and pricing data clearly and concisely in a \ncost volume summary.\nIn commercial markets, many bidders think that their price is \nhigher than their competitors’, so they sometimes try to hide \ntheir price. Instead, disclose your price early in the executive \nsummary. To limit the customer’s ability to negotiate, include \ndetailed price breakdowns only when required.\nPRESENTING COST AND PRICE DATA\nWhile the focus of this topic is on \npresenting cost and price data \nin a proposal, the guidance \napplies equally to pre-submittal \nand post-submittal customer \npresentations.\nCost and price depend on per-\nspective. Your proposed price \nis the customer’s cost but often \nnot the total cost. Customers \ntake your price and add acquisi-\ntion management, implementa-\ntion costs, and risk premiums.\nPRESENTING COST AND PRICE DATA\nInclude pricing and a value proposition in the \nexecutive summary, unless prohibited.\nExplain and quantify, where possible, your added-\nvalue components instead of just claiming to offer \nadded value.\nPresent cost and price data graphically to engage \nsenior management, promote rapid understanding, \nand establish perspective.\n1\n2\n3\nSubstantiate cost or pricing with past \nperformance data.\nPresent relative cost comparisons in the technical \nproposal when actual cost data is not permitted.\nPrepare a cost volume summary for markets where \ncosts are prohibited in the technical proposal.\n4\n5\n6\nPresenting cost and price data is sometimes neglected in different ways in different markets. Federal government bidders see it \nas a time-consuming process of completing numerous forms and spreadsheets. Commercial bidders may hide their price in the \nback of their proposal, thinking that will force the customer to read their proposal and discover their added value.\n\nPresenting Cost and Price Data\nShipley Proposal Guide\n195\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nINCLUDE PRICING AND A VALUE PROPOSITION IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, \nUNLESS PROHIBITED.\nSales professionals who get the opportunity to present \ntheir proposal to their customer usually say they keep the \ncustomer’s attention for about 5 minutes. Then the customer \nbegins turning through the proposal, looking for the price.\nYou gain credibility by putting your price and the value \nproposition in the executive summary, unless prohibited.\nEven when price is not the most important factor, price \ninvariably falls into the customer’s top four hot buttons. \nEven if price is a minor selection factor, customers have a \nbudget. Price is a rapid screening factor as long as several \nbidders are within the customer’s \nbudget. Consider the following \nexamples:\nA company was bidding an IT sup-\nport contract to a large city, priced at \napproximately $1 million. The price was \nplaced on the front page of the executive \nsummary in bold type larger than the \ntext. The seller’s comment, “We offered \nexcellent value for money. Why hide our price?”  The customer’s com-\nment, “We appreciated having the price on the first page. Everyone \nelse hid theirs.”\nIf you wonder whether \nprice is important, con-\nsider how your account \nexecutives spend their \ntime when the proposal is \nbeing prepared. Do they \nspend more time seeking \na price cut or reviewing \nthe proposal? \n2\t\nEXPLAIN AND QUANTIFY, WHERE POSSIBLE, YOUR ADDED-VALUE COMPONENTS \nINSTEAD OF JUST CLAIMING TO OFFER ADDED VALUE.\nMost sellers claim to offer added value. Many government bid \nrequests cite best value as an award criterion. Yet few sellers \nexplain or attempt to quantify their added value.\nAdded value is essentially quantified cost-benefit selling. \nFigure 1 illustrates the concept. \nPrice to the seller is the cost plus profit, assuming the sale is \nprofitable. However, the customer sees the price as the cost. \nThese terms change as the perspective changes.\nAdded value to the customer is the difference between the \nvalue of the benefits of the solution and the customer’s costs. \nThe customer’s costs include both the purchase cost and \npotential implementation costs. \nCustomers trying to obtain maximum added value must \ndetermine the difference between the value of each seller’s \nsolution and the total cost to the customer of each seller’s \nsolution. \nOn Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) acquisitions, \nprice becomes the primary evaluation factor, if all technical \nrequirements are met.\nThe capture manager or sales lead should \ncollaborate with the customer to develop \na comprehensive value proposition. Only \ncustomers can accord value. See VALUE \nPROPOSITIONS, Capture Guide.\nAdded Value\nA’s added value = (16-10) = 6\nB’s added value = (11-8) = 3\nFor one unit of added cost, the buyer \ngets three additional units of added \nvalue. Providing that A is within the \nbuyer’s budget, A offers the greatest \nadded value.\nSeller B’s \nAdded Value\nSeller A’s Added Value\nSeller A’s \nValue\nSeller A’s \nPrice\nSeller B’s \nValue\nSeller B’s \nPrice\nPrice\nCost\nPerceived Value\nPrice\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nFigure 1. Understanding the Concept of Added Value. Most propos-\nals claim to offer greater added value but never attempt to explain or \njustify their claim. Credible explanations require an intimate under-\nstanding of the customer’s business and collaboration to understand \nthe customer’s cost and value structure. \n\nPresenting Cost and Price Data\nShipley Proposal Guide\n196\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nPRESENT COST AND PRICE DATA GRAPHICALLY TO ENGAGE SENIOR MANAGEMENT, \nPROMOTE RAPID UNDERSTANDING, AND ESTABLISH PERSPECTIVE.\nGraphic presentation of cost and pricing data elevates the \nanalysis to the level where best value decisions can be made. \nExamine your proposed costs or prices from the point of view \nof the customer’s senior management.\nSenior managers are interested in the following cost or price-\nspecific items:\n•\t How is the cost spread among products and services?\n•\t What are the major cost drivers?\n•\t What is the spending pattern over time both in total and \nby major cost category?\n•\t Which costs are at risk, and what is being done to manage \nthat risk?\n•\t Which items are subcontracted?\n•\t Who are the major subcontractors, and where are they \nlocated?\nPotential ways of presenting different cost elements are listed \nin figure 2.

Enhance credibility by citing how this data has been \nadjusted for future conditions.\nUnderstanding how government cost analysts evaluate cost \nproposals will help proposal writers in all markets. Cost \nanalysts begin with two primary assumptions:\n1.\t Nothing is new. Everything has been done before.\nEven if the overall task has never been done, the subtasks, \nwhen sufficiently segmented and defined, have all been \ndone before.\n2.\t The accuracy of cost estimates is directly related to the \nbasis of the estimate.\nCost analysts rank the following basis of cost estimates \nfrom most accurate and credible to least accurate and \ncredible:\n\t– Firm negotiated price by future delivery date\n\t– Actual past price paid, escalated for future delivery \nbased on an accepted cost index\n\t– Vendor quote\n\t– Engineering judgment\nOn seeing engineering judgment as the basis of estimate, one \ncost analyst said, “I offer them 25 to 50 percent of their quoted \nprice and see what they can do to justify any amount above \nthat figure.”\nSee RELEVANT EXPERIENCE/ \nPAST PERFORMANCE.\nVendor quotes, cited by many estimators \nas the most reliable, are negotiated and \npurchased at a lower price. Analysts \napply a negotiation decrement to vendor \nquotes.\n\nPresenting Cost and Price Data\nShipley Proposal Guide\n197\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nPRESENT RELATIVE COST COMPARISONS IN THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL WHEN \nACTUAL COST DATA IS NOT PERMITTED.\nRelative cost comparisons in a technical proposal help justify \nyour approach compared to alternative solutions when direct \ncost figures are not allowed.\nEvaluators are trying to compare approaches and want \nto know that a bidder considered all feasible alternatives. \nMany technical people complete an exhaustive analysis of \nalternatives, select one, then describe only the selected \napproach in their proposal. Evaluators get the impression that \nonly one approach was considered.\nWhen costs cannot be included in the technical proposal, \npresent relative cost comparisons:\n1.\t Cite your selection criteria.\n2.\t List the alternative considered.\n3.\t Justify your selected approach.\n4.\t Cite cost differences in relative terms.\n5.\t Explain why others were not selected.\nNote potential changes in your selection if the selection factors \nchange or the importance of the selection factors change.\n6\t\nPREPARE A COST VOLUME SUMMARY FOR MARKETS WHERE COSTS  \nARE PROHIBITED IN THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.\nBeginning the cost volume with a summary is a best practice \nin federal proposals. \nEvaluators of the cost volume rarely make the selection \ndecision, and decision makers rarely look at the cost volume \nbecause it is too difficult to quickly understand. A good cost \nvolume summary can be read and understood by the decision \nmakers and senior influencers and positively sets up the cost \nanalysts’ evaluation of the cost volume. \nA cost volume summary uses the graphical presentation \nmethods outlined in guideline 3 in this section to present a \nclear, easily read summary of your costs for the customer’s \nsenior management and decision makers.\nFederal cost analysts must prepare a summary document, a \nPrice Analysis Report, to summarize their evaluation. Think \nof the cost volume summary as the draft of the report you \nwould like the cost analyst to present to the source selection \nauthority or decision maker.\nPlace a copy of your executive summary in the front of the cost \nvolume—directly in the binder or in the pocket in the binder \ncover. Make it available to every cost analyst.\nPrepare a cost volume summary that meets as many of the \nfollowing objectives as possible:\n•\t Projects overall proposal themes\n•\t Overviews your approach\n•\t Discusses total prices or costs in graphics and words\n•\t Discusses price and cost implications of your approach \nwhile ghosting alternative approaches\n•\t Emphasizes how costs are fair  \nand reasonable \n•\t Summarizes exceptions taken to the RFP\n•\t Summarizes your estimating approach\n•\t Summarizes how costs are accurately tracked  \nand controlled\n•\t Demonstrates sound logic\n•\t Indicates your cost system has been audited and \napproved by the appropriate agencies\nAn open mockup of a cost volume summary for a large, \nmultiphase systems program is shown in thumbnail version in \nModel Document 13. \nEvaluators look favorably at proposals that are easy to \nevaluate, giving them higher scores. A 40-year veteran of cost \nproposal evaluation made the following comment:\nA well-organized cost proposal is traceable. I should be able to open \nthe cost volume at random, page backward or forward to the begin-\nning of any subsection, and directly see where it ties to other sections. \nI can see where these costs are supported in greater detail and where \nthey roll up to the next cost level.\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n198\n©Shipley Associates\nPROCESS\nOrganizations with effective business and proposal \ndevelopment processes gain the following benefits:\n•\t Reduced costs\n•\t Increased productivity\n•\t Improved forecasting\n•\t Higher win rates\n•\t Increased management visibility and control\nDefining, building, and implementing an effective business \ndevelopment process require management focus and \ncontinuous effort. Barriers include corporate inertia, individual \nresistance to change, and constantly changing priorities that \nblur focus and erode commitment.\nThe motivation to adjust an organization’s business \ndevelopment process often stems from one of the following \nsituations:\n•\t Merged or reorganized organizations\n•\t Changes in management\n•\t Failure to meet sales or win-rate goals\n•\t Staffing fluctuations and personnel changes\n•\t Sale of the organization\n•\t Analysts’ concerns affecting stock price\n•\t Maturing markets or market shifts\n•\t Loss of key customers or contracts\nThe following guidelines focus on proposal development \ncomponents within the overall business development process.\nProcess is defined as a systematic series of actions or steps directed toward a specific end. Consistently successful proposal \nmanagers repeatedly follow defined and documented processes based on best practices.\nCommit to a single, flexible, tailorable, scalable \nbusiness development process based on industry \nbest practices and championed at the executive level.\nDefine process phases broadly, delineated by clear \nmilestones with verifiable inputs and outputs.\nUse consistent reviews at each milestone to control \nand add value to the process.\nAlign your proposal development process with \ncorporate policies, strategies, practices, and other \nprocesses.\nDocument your proposal development \nprocess to make it consistent and repeatable.\nTrain contributors to give them the understanding \nand skills to follow the process.\n6\n7\n8\nPROCESS\n1\n2\n3\nAdapt your proposal process to individual \nopportunities by using flexible support tools.\nDefine business and proposal development roles, \nresponsibilities, and levels of authority, including \nthresholds by type of opportunities.\nDesignate a process owner to collect metrics, foster \ncontinuous improvement, and maintain tools and \ninfrastructure.\n9\n4\n5\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n199\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nCOMMIT TO A SINGLE, FLEXIBLE, TAILORABLE, AND SCALABLE BUSINESS  \nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS BASED ON INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES AND  \nCHAMPIONED AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL.\nOrganizations with a single process can conduct business \nmore efficiently and effectively. Every opportunity falls \nwithin the single, yet flexible, process. Individuals assigned \nto proposal teams can immediately focus on the opportunity \nrather than determining or justifying what needs to be done.\nA flexible process works for you, not against you, by including \nbest practices based on the type and size of opportunity. \nA tailorable process implies that phases, decision gate reviews, \nand color team reviews are included based on type, size, and \nvalue of the opportunity. Milestones might be mandatory, \nrecommended, optional, or not applicable.\nA scalable process can be adapted to the size, delivery \ndeadline, and available resources. For example, a mandatory \nkickoff meeting might be shortened, conducted virtually, and \ninclude fewer participants. A color team review might be serial \nand virtual rather than a co-located, single event. \nRegularly compare your process to other organizations, by \nparticipating in industry forums and professional associations, \nand by engaging professionals who specialize in business \ndevelopment best practice.\nAn individual at the executive level should help your \norganization realize the benefits of committing to a single, \nflexible, tailorable, and scalable business development \nprocess.\n2\t\nDEFINE PROCESS PHASES BROADLY, DELINEATED BY CLEAR MANDATORY  \nMILESTONES WITH VERIFIABLE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS.\nDefine business development phases broadly to include the \nwide variety of opportunities your organization may pursue. \nNarrower definitions encourage participants to work outside \nthe process. \nPhases are separated by decision gates, where executives \ndetermine whether or not to allocate resources to continue \nthe business pursuit. A business development lifecycle shown \nin figure 1 is divided into seven phases. Phase 0 and Phase \n1 are cyclical and customer-focused. Phases 2 through 6 are \nopportunity specific and project oriented.\n•\t Phase 0: Market Segmentation. Marketing teams are \nformed by senior management to explore potential \nmarkets or to target market segments most likely to buy \nwhat your organization offers.\n•\t Phase 1: Long-Term Positioning. Campaign plans are \nexecuted to establish your organization’s presence with \nspecific customers, all aimed at identifying leads or \nopportunities.\n•\t Phase 2: Opportunity Assessment. Newly identified \nopportunities are assessed and qualified to determine \nyour organization’s interest and whether they are \nwinnable.\n•\t Phase 3: Capture/Opportunity Planning. Individuals in \ncustomers’ organizations are influenced to prefer your \norganization and solution.\n•\t Phase 4: Proposal Planning. The proposal effort is \nplanned while your organization’s capture efforts \ncontinue and while the customer is preparing the bid \nrequest.\n•\t Phase 5: Proposal Development. Your proposal is \nprepared, approved, and submitted.\n•\t Phase 6: Post-Submittal Activities. Customers’ questions \nare answered, hopefully leading to negotiations and \ncontract award.\n0\n4\n3\n2\n1\n5\n6\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n200\n©Shipley Associates\nDefining clear, mandatory milestones with verifiable inputs \nand outputs establishes a solid business development process \nfor opportunities, large or small. Predefined quality checks \nand business case justifications at each milestone minimize \nwasted proposal development efforts and increase win \nrates. All opportunities benefit from a few, well-conceived \nmanagement milestone reviews. Each phase ends with a \nspecific decision gate, summarized below:\n•\t Gate 0: Marketing/Campaign Decision. Management \ndecides whether the pursuit of a potential market or \nsegment fits your organization’s long-term strategic goals.\n•\t Gate 1: Interest Decision. Management verifies whether \nthe pursuit of a specific customer seems to fit your \norganization’s direction and justifies investment in sales \nactivities.\n•\t Gate 2: Pursuit Decision. Management assesses the \nopportunity, the customer, and the competition to decide \nwhether to invest in business capture activities.\n•\t Gate 3: Preliminary Bid Decision. Management evaluates \nyour opportunity-specific capture pursuits, including win \nstrategy, competitive position, technical/management \nsolution, and price-to-win, to decide whether to plan a \nproposal.\n•\t Gate 4: Bid Validation Decision. Management confirms \nyour tentative plan to prepare a proposal after reviewing \nthe customer’s bid request. If approved, proposal \ndevelopment begins immediately. \n•\t Gate 5: Proposal Submittal Decision. Management \ndecides whether your completed proposal presents your \norganization and offer acceptably and whether any risks \nare justified by the probable financial reward.\n•\t Gate 6: Final Offer Decision. If changes have occurred \nsince your original offer was submitted, this is \nmanagement’s last opportunity to accept or reject the \ndeal.\nGates\nMarketing/Campaign \nDecision\nCustomer \nMilestones\nIdentify and Define Needs\nInterest \nDecision\nLifecycle \nPhases\nPursuit \nDecision\nStrategic Plan\nPursuit Recom-\nmendation\nAnnual  \nBusiness Plan\nAccount Plan\nMarketing Plan\nDocuments\nCompetitive \nAssessment\nOpportunity Plan\nPhase 2.

Without reviews, you cannot control and \nmanage work. The quality of a business development review \nreflects the quality of the work done to research, develop the \nopportunity, and collaborate with the customer. Each review \nshould incorporate consistent requirements, appropriately \ntailored for the type and size of the opportunity.\nManage to your expectations. Do not omit reviews or \ncompromise your standards. Figure 1 suggests documents \nand plans for each milestone review. These may need to be \nadapted to your organization. The availability and quality of \nthese documents and plans at the review are indicators of \nyour readiness to advance to the next phase. Poor preparation \ncould raise serious doubt about continuing to spend resources.\n4\t\nADAPT YOUR PROPOSAL PROCESS TO INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITIES BY USING \nFLEXIBLE SUPPORT TOOLS.\nNo single process is right for every business organization and \nevery opportunity. The one shown in figure 1 is widely useful, \nbut every step might not be right for your products, services, \nor market. The tasks completed during each phase need to be \nadjusted based on the following considerations:\n•\t Value of bid, both in absolute terms and in comparison to \nother business you have\n•\t Knowledge of customer, especially relating to prior \nworking relationships\n•\t Time projected to be available during each phase of the \nbusiness development cycle\n•\t Similarity of new business to other work your \norganization has performed\n•\t Type of bid\n•\t Knowledge of other competitors\n•\t Expectations in the marketplace concerning \nsophistication of proposals and other aspects of business \ndevelopment process\nLikewise, the information required to support the milestone \nreviews may be different. For example, in a commodity \nmarket, knowledge of competitors may not play a large role in \ndeciding whether to bid; instead, information about price will \nbe more significant in each phase. \nRegardless, a consistent process will help you spend more \nof your business development resources pursuing better \nopportunities. You will typically submit fewer bids, but will \nimprove your win rate and total dollars won.\nHigh-level process definition provides structure, but you need \nflexible tools to respond to shifting market demands.\nTools need to support both knowledge and process \nmanagement. Knowledge management includes boilerplate \ndevelopment, retrieval, and maintenance. It also \nsupports collaborative solution development \nby giving access to previous work and products. \nProcess management tools can direct the user, \nsave time, and improve effectiveness.\nPotential tools come in many forms, from templates and \nforms to fully integrated web-based, electronic systems. To \nbe broadly accepted, your process must do more than give \ndirection—it must help users do their jobs \neffectively and efficiently. Tools that save \ntime and improve effectiveness help users \nand promote acceptance and adherence to \nyour process.\nThe best business development tools are \nadaptable to a broad range of opportunities and proposals. \nThey help collect, organize, and analyze information so better \ndecisions can be made. Ultimately, they help your organization \nprepare winning proposals.\nNot all tools are created equal. Some tools speed the activity \ncycle, permitting a user to produce more proposals. But if \nthe effectiveness of the proposal is unchanged, the cost of \nthe tool may exceed the benefits. The best tools empower \nthe user to be better organized, more customer-focused, and \nmore responsive to the specific requirements of each business \nopportunity. \nSee PROPOSAL \nPREPARATION \nTOOLS.\nSee BID DECISIONS; \nand DECISION GATE \nREVIEWS and  \nCOLOR TEAM \nREVIEWS, Capture \nGuide.\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n202\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nDEFINE BUSINESS AND PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, \nAND LEVELS OF AUTHORITY, INCLUDING THRESHOLDS BY TYPES OF  \nOPPORTUNITIES.\nRoles are customary functions of a person in business \ndevelopment, such as capture manager, proposal manager, \nproposal specialist, writer, graphic \nartist, and estimator. A single \nperson can fill multiple roles. In \nsome organizations, a person in the \naccount manager position might \nassume sales, proposal manager, \nproposal writer, estimator, and \nreviewer roles. \nResponsibilities are tasks that people are accountable for, \nwhether they complete the task themselves or assign the \ntask to another. In business development, people in roles are \nassigned specific responsibilities. Traditionally, an individual \nin the proposal manager role is \nresponsible for the preparation \nof the proposal document to a \ndefined standard.\nLevels of authority establish the power of a person to \ncommand, direct, or decide. Levels of authority establish \nwhether the person can make a decision and the limits of the \ndecision. For example, the level of authority to make pursuit, \nbid, and bid submittal decisions usually varies with the size \nand risk of the opportunity.\nProposal development processes are more flexible and \nscalable when roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority \nare clearly defined. \nProposal contributors need to know the following:\n•\t What is the big picture? \n•\t What does the customer value?\n•\t What do you want me to do?\n•\t When is it due? \n•\t What is my budget and charge code?\n•\t What are your quality standards or expectations?\nAll contributors should be briefed on the importance of \nwinning the opportunity.\nWhen business \ndevelopment staff \ncircumvent your \nprocess, your process \nmay no longer fit your \ncircumstances. Processes \ncan be changed, but \nshould not be modified \nwithout good reason.\nSee APPENDIX A: TEAM ROLES \nAND RESPONSIBILITIES,  \nBusiness Development  \nLifecycle Guide.\n6\t\nALIGN YOUR PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WITH CORPORATE POLICIES, \nSTRATEGIES, PRACTICES, AND OTHER PROCESSES. \nAlignment is critical in all areas. A corporate strategy to be the \ntechnology leader is more compatible with a sales approach \nthat emphasizes added value than one that stresses low price. \nFor each opportunity, align your sales strategy, proposal \nstrategy, boilerplate, and solution.\nAlign performance metrics, incentives, and proposal \ndevelopment processes:\n•\t Share sales or capture team information with the \nproposal team.\n•\t Streamline the proposal review process to support a short \nsales and proposal delivery schedule.\n•\t Balance reviewers’ rewards for preventing risk with the \npotential cost of lost sales.\nBe sure all pursuit strategies ultimately support your \norganization’s strategy.\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n203\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nDOCUMENT YOUR PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT \nAND REPEATABLE.\nDocument your proposal development process as part of \nyour business development process. Documenting only your \nproposal process is less effective. Your process also needs to \nbe easily accessible and visible within your organization.\nTo avoid losing proposal contributors in complexity, consider \ndeveloping small, compact or online proposal process guides. \nAlternatively, embed your process in your tools, making much \nof the process transparent.\nFollow your defined process and use your tools. Contributors \nfollow what you do, not what you say. \nFinally, consider contributor turnover. Mix experienced and \ninexperienced contributors, if possible. \n8\t\nTRAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO GIVE THEM THE UNDERSTANDING AND SKILLS  \nTO FOLLOW THE PROCESS.\nEven contributors who understand and accept the process \nneed the skills to execute and adapt it appropriately. The same \napplies to support tools. Users must be able to locate, acquire, \nand use tools properly.\nAn initial and ongoing investment in training is critical. To \nachieve maximum return, training must be process specific \nand role specific. Otherwise, people will not understand the \nreasons for their assigned tasks.\nProposal development process and tool training cannot \nconsist of lectures and one-time demonstrations. Participants \nmust practice the expected skills during the training and \nreceive immediate feedback to improve their performance. \nMentors and coaches should also be designated to reinforce \nlearning and monitor best practices. Without practice, \nparticipants usually return to their pre-training approach. \n9\t\nDESIGNATE A PROCESS OWNER TO COLLECT METRICS, FOSTER CONTINUOUS \nIMPROVEMENT, AND MAINTAIN TOOLS AND INFRASTRUCTURE.\nProcesses erode quickly without an owner. Turnover, loss \nof learning, and even active resistance to process discipline \nreduce process effectiveness. Consider these all too  \ncommon occurrences:\n•\t A simple template with an outdated logo is used, creating \nan inconsistent brand image.\n•\t An electronic template incompatible with an upgraded \noperating system is abandoned, forcing business \ndevelopment staff back to inaccurate, inefficient,  \nmanual techniques.\n•\t Boilerplate graphics and text describing obsolete \nproducts and services prompt a customer to select \nanother source.\n•\t Inadequate reviews lead to unacceptable risk or  \nlow profit margins.\n•\t Contract disputes arise because the bidder is not fully \naware of the content of a proposal.\nAssigning an owner to implement, monitor, and improve the \nprocess keeps the benefits alive.\nAn initial \nand ongoing \ninvestment \nin training is \ncritical.\n“ \n”\n\nProcess\nShipley Proposal Guide\n204\n©Shipley Associates\nThe process owner and management should establish metrics \nto measure improvement and success. \nMetrics are a basis for continuous improvement—we manage \nwhat we measure. Define metrics to monitor sales support \ncosts, cycle times, and proposal quality. All are usually related \nto higher win rates.\nMetrics help process owners understand which elements of \ntheir processes work well and which need to be changed. \nAccurate and credible metrics are the only valid way to \njustify requests for additional resources, to resist reductions \nin current resources, or to measure the value of enabling \ntechnologies and tools.\nConsider the following questions when determining what \nmetrics to collect:\n•\t How will you use this metric? If you cannot anticipate \nits use, do not track it. For example, tracking turnaround \ntime from different outside printing vendors could \nhelp you decide which printer has earned more of your \nbusiness. The same statistic from an internal department \nthat is giving good service is less useful.\n•\t Can the metric be collected with minimum impact to \nstaff and clients? Try to capture metrics as by-products \nof your normal process. For example, collect labor hours \nfrom time sheets. Determine page counts from printing \nrecords.\n•\t Does the potential value of the data exceed the cost \nof collection? A relatively expensive program to obtain \ncustomers’ feedback on wins and losses is often justified. \nConversely, one process owner decided not to compute \na cost per page even though it could be calculated from \navailable data. Central expenses were minimal, proposal \nteams worked virtually from home offices, so travel \ncosts were eliminated, and internal printing costs were \nannually allocated to business units on a revenue basis. \nNeither the process owner nor the responsible mangers \ncould think of a use for the cost-per-page metric.\n•\t Does the metric broaden your potential understanding \nof a process that you own or can influence? Keeping \nmetrics on organizations or individuals outside your \ncontrol and influence may only lead to conflict. If you \nhave no control over your field sales force, why track data \non account executives? Leave that to sales management.\nAvoid tracking metrics that overlap unless you are trying to \ndetermine which metric is most representative. For example, \noverlapping metrics might be kept on desktop publishing \n(DTP). You could track pages per day of combined graphics \nand text, or separate measures of pages per day of text and \ngraphics per day. The appropriate measure might depend on \nwhether your DTP professional also does the graphics and \nwhether the ratio of graphics per page is expected to change. \nFigure 3 lists potential business development process metrics.\nCOMMONLY COLLECTED PROPOSAL METRICS\nProposal Quality\nDuration (start to finish)\nStaff hours expended\nHours by resource\nProposal won/lost\nDollars won/lost\nNumber of copies\nPage count\nNumber of graphics\nPercent new vs. existing graphics\nFigure 3.

Poorly prepared \nor differently presented or appended materials suggest \nuneven and inconsistent quality. \nDecide early how the proposal will be produced and delivered \nas the process will affect schedules, timelines, and how the \nproposal is written. Decisions on layout, software, graphics, \nand color can significantly affect production. Be completely \nsure what the customer expects upon submission.\nProduction personnel frequently are under-appreciated, \nmisunderstood, involved too late in the process, and \nrepeatedly abused. However, some \nproduction managers forget that they \nmanage a service organization.\nExcellent production support \nthroughout the proposal preparation \nprocess is essential to consistently \nwin competitive business. \nWhile having a dedicated proposal production support group \nis ideal for control purposes, three extremes are possible:\nPRODUCTION\nProduction is the step that turns all of your hard work into the product that represents the quality of your products and services. \nCustomers assume that if you cannot organize a team well enough to produce a quality document, then you probably cannot \ndeliver quality products and services.\nCustomers may \nrequire offerors to \nsubmit both a paper \n“original” and an \nelectronic “copy” of all \nproposal documents. \nSee ELECTRONIC \nSUBMITTAL.\nPublications groups may have conflicting, prior commitments; \nlimited familiarity with customer-directed documents; and \na \"first in, first out\" approach. Carefully plan all aspects of \nproduction and delivery.\nProduction is done by the sales support staff or the proposal team. \nBoth may lack the time, skills, and resources required.\n1\nProduction is done by a company organization that also supports \nproduct manuals, newsletters, brochures, technical reports, and \nmarketing presentations. \n2\nProduction is outsourced to an organization that specializes in \nhigh-volume printing, binding, and delivery of varied documents \nfor multiple clients.\n3\n\nProduction\nShipley Proposal Guide\n206\n©Shipley Associates\nPRODUCTION\nEstablish a clear vision of what the customer \nexpects to be delivered.\nIdentify and assign the production \nmanagement role and include that person in \nyour core team planning.\nSet clear ground rules in a written proposal \nproduction plan to minimize rework.\n1\n2\n3\nDetermine how the proposal will be packaged \nand delivered while section writers are planning \nand preparing initial drafts.\nMaintain a secure master book of hard-copy \nfiles backed by electronic files.\nDiligently enforce version control on a \nsection-by-section basis.\n6\n7\n8\nDetermine precisely what will be produced \nfor each color team review.\n4\nIncrease your quality checks and production \ntime if proposal production is remote.\n9\nTest systems prior to production.\n5\nSee COMPLIANCE AND \nRESPONSIVENESS and \nOUTLINING.\n1\t\nESTABLISH A CLEAR VISION OF WHAT THE CUSTOMER EXPECTS  \nTO BE DELIVERED.\nUnderstand the customer’s expectations. Imagine getting a \n1,000-page proposal when you expected 100 pages. Imagine \nthe opposite. Similarly, imagine preparing only hard copies of \nyour proposal when the customer expects only soft copies.\nWhen the customer establishes clear document preparation \nand delivery requirements in the bid request, follow them. \nWhen these requirements are unclear or unstated in the bid \nrequest, or when preparing an unsolicited proposal, explicitly \ndiscuss proposal requirements with the customer.\nGuide the customer toward a proposal \nthat is both easier to evaluate and \neasier to prepare, usually a shorter proposal. Be careful about \nwhat you suggest; you may get it, as these examples illustrate:\nAn account executive asked if the customer would like to see a video \nsubmitted with the proposal. When the customer said, “Yes,” the \naccount executive’s organization had limited time and resources to \nproduce anything that looked better than an amateur, home movie.\nAn account executive asked the customer if they would like to see \na concise proposal that simply focused on what they planned to \ndo on the immediate project. The customer agreed. Unfortunately, \nthe account executive’s support group was only equipped to do a    \nSearch and Replace for the customer’s name and print 250 pages of \nboilerplate.\n2\t\nIDENTIFY AND ASSIGN THE PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT ROLE AND INCLUDE \nTHAT PERSON IN YOUR CORE TEAM PLANNING.\nThe production management lead supervises the publication \nprocess, including word processing and graphic support, \ndesktop publishing to integrate text and graphics, overall \ndocument design, and printing. \nThe complexity of the proposal influences whether the \nproduction lead role is assigned to the proposal coordinator, \nthe proposal manager, or to a separate full-time position. Early \ninvolvement reduces the cost of proposal rework far more \nthan the cost of the production lead’s time. \nInvolve the production lead early to foster a commitment to \ndo what is needed to win. Ideally, the production lead, graphic \nartists, and editors are directly assigned to support individual \nproposal teams. Small organizations might appoint various \nsupport personnel as production leads.\n\nProduction\nShipley Proposal Guide\n207\n©Shipley Associates\nProposal managers on larger proposals do not have to be \nproduction experts, but they do need to know what to discuss \nwith the person who is assigned the production management \nrole. The proposal lead, the proposal coordinator, or the \nproduction manager should prepare the following items: \n•\t Presubmission Checklist: Lists all items required by the \ncustomer.\n•\t Printing and Delivery Checklist: Lists all items that \nmust be selected or prepared and all tasks that must \nbe completed that are relevant to printing, document \nassembly, packaging, and shipment\n•\t Print Mockup: Tells the printer how to correctly assemble \nthe proposal.\nA sample presubmission checklist and a printing and delivery \nchecklist are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively. When you \nshow these examples to most production managers, they will \nnearly always understand and complete the checklists for your \nproposal. \nPresubmission Checklist\nITEM\nNOTES\n  Cover \n  Cover Letter \n  Proprietary/Nondisclosure Notice \n  Signature Papers \n  Bid Bond \n  Performance Bond \n  Small or Disadvantaged Business Qualification \n  All Certifications of Compliance \n  Table of Contents \n  Compliance Matrix/Cross-Reference Matrix \n  List of Figures \n  Acronyms/Glossary/Definitions \n  Executive Summary \n  Technical Volume \n  Management Volume \n  Support Volume \n  Relevant Experience/Past Performance \nVolume \n  Cost Volume \n  WBS/WBS Dictionary \n  Index \n  Appendices \n  Exceptions \n  Brochures, Data Sheets, Reports \n  List of Sources of Supporting Materials \n Supplementary Technical Data or Reports \nFigure 1.

Include ground rules in the writers’ \npackages distributed at the kickoff meeting. \nSet ground rules to manage the flow and style  (such as \nspacing, boxing, or shading) for the following items:\n•\t Content plans, including storyboards and mockups\n•\t Graphics\n•\t Section drafts\n•\t Time and material estimates \nFlow procedures define how the drafts are processed and \nusually include deadlines. Style procedures set standards for \neach document, both form and content.\nStyle procedures for writers should be kept as simple as \npossible to both save writers’ time and to simplify production. \nExtra formatting by writers must be removed by production \nbefore imposing a standard style sheet. Eliminate this  \nwasted effort.\nConfiguration control ensures the most \ncurrent version of each proposal section is \nsafely stored and available on an as-needed \nbasis to other members of the proposal team. \nInsist on a written production plan, which is the only clear \nproof that you have that the plan is complete and correct.\nYour written proposal production plan should address both \nprocess and production issues.\nProcess issues\n•\t How documents are prepared, reviewed, and printed\n•\t How hard and soft files are managed, named, stored, and \nbacked up\n•\t How various proposal tools, templates, and forms are \nobtained, used, submitted, displayed, and reviewed\n•\t Who will be given access to files and materials, and the \ndegree of access permitted\nProduction issues\n•\t How the proposal will appear, including a detailed \nelectronic style sheet that establishes both interim and \nfinal page layout, headers, footers, font choice and size, etc.\n•\t What materials will be used, including paper, tabs, \nbinders, or spiral binding, etc.\n•\t What types of headings, captions, jargon, acronyms, \ntitles, and naming conventions will be used\n•\t What, how, and who will prepare other required items, \nsuch as the cover letter, table of contents, compliance \nor cross reference matrix, lists of figures, acronym list, \nglossary or index, transmittal letter, tabs, and special \nforms or certifications\n•\t How the proposal will be produced, including the number \nof copies and volumes; printing schedule; printer, backup \nprinter; special print needs such as oversize documents, \npockets, or tabs; and color photographs or pages\n•\t How security will be maintained on all materials from the \nkickoff through final production and archiving\nSee KICKOFF \nMEETING and \nPROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT \nPLAN.\n4\t\nDETERMINE PRECISELY WHAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR EACH COLOR  \nTEAM REVIEW.\nInterim reviews create a production \ndilemma. Senior reviewers give a more \nthorough review to material that looks \nmore professional. Yet more professional material increases \nproduction support costs.\nCompromise by reviewing for the right things at the right time. \nAt the Blue Team, review your competitive position, strategy, \nand baseline solution. Prepare copies of the first draft of \nthe executive summary, the Bidder Comparison Chart, the \nIntegrated Customer Solution Worksheet, other competitive \nassessment products, strategy statements assembled into \na strategy white paper, and prospective win themes. None \nrequire extensive production assistance. \nMake reference materials available for each evaluator, such as \na draft or final bid request, and relevant marketing intelligence.\nLimit the Pink Team review to the storyboards and mockups. \nSome organizations include the first draft of the proposal, \nand others have multiple Pink Teams, reviewing each \nadditional draft. \nSee COLOR TEAM \nREVIEWS.\n\nProduction\nShipley Proposal Guide\n209\n©Shipley Associates\nFew organizations pursuing non-federal business have time \nfor more than one Pink Team review. Assuming content plans \nare reviewed on the walls, displayed on tables, or posted on \na secure website, then production assistance is limited to \npreparing reference materials and comment forms for  \neach reviewer. \nMost reviewers expect a near-final document for the  \nRed Team. You can reduce your production cost and  \nperhaps facilitate revisions if management will agree to  \nthe following simplifications:\n•\t Print all review copies on paper with pre-punched holes  \nand insert them in ring binders. Copying on one side  \nsimplifies production moderately, but reviewers will not  \nsee opposing pages.\n•\t Start each section on a new page to facilitate dividing the \nproposal for different reviewers and distributing pages with \nreviewers’ comments to the people making revisions.\nIf reviewers are given electronic files, consider the form and \nplanned review process. Does the file type support comments? \nDo reviewers have access to and are they comfortable using \nthis software for a review? How easy is it to consolidate \nreviewers’ comments?\nThe Gold Team reviews the fully completed proposal, \nincluding all cover letters and introductory materials, all files \nand folders, all attachments and appendices, and any other \ndocumentation or signatures required by the customer. This \nfinal “book check” verifies that all modifications approved by \nthe Red Team and Green Team were accomplished. Changes \nshould be minimal and only if absolutely necessary.\nIdentify production support needs early. Estimate how many \ntimes each page will be produced both before and after the \nRed Team.

Estimate and Identify Production Support. Obtain the \nnecessary production support. Without adequate support, writers \nwith limited production skills are forced to prepare their own  \ngraphics and design pages. Proposal quality drops, and the total  \ncost increases. \nSee SCHEDULING.\n5\t\nTEST SYSTEMS PRIOR TO PRODUCTION. \nIf systems are not checked, something may go wrong, \nespecially with electronic submissions. Proposal managers \nfrequently see one of the following problems:\n•\t Screened or shaded effects will fade on one copier and \nincrease in intensity on another, obscuring the text. \n•\t Word-processed proposals will print differently \ndepending on the printer, the printer driver, and the \nprecise supplier of the selected font. Fonts with the same \nname from different vendors might print differently.\n•\t When sending electronic proposals, the only way to \nensure the document will print exactly as intended is to \nsend it in PDF format.\n•\t Contributors are likely to be using different software or \ndifferent releases of the same software, especially if they \ndevelop their own graphics.\n•\t When files are sent via email or an electronic portal, \nfiles can be corrupted by different ISPs (Internet Service \nProviders), firewalls, and mail encoders and decoders \n(plug-ins).\nCheck everything, especially when you have remote \ncontributors or teaming partners.\nSee ELECTRONIC \nSUBMITTAL.\n\nProduction\nShipley Proposal Guide\n210\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nDETERMINE HOW THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PACKAGED AND DELIVERED WHILE \nSECTION WRITERS ARE PLANNING AND PREPARING INITIAL DRAFTS.\nPackaging includes determining the binding method, the size \nand number of binders required, and cover art. More than a \nfew proposal managers have been surprised by proposals that \noutgrew the binders that were ordered. \nCover art can get your proposal read in a commercial \ncompetition. Good covers both attract readers and project the \nbidder’s win strategy. If you develop custom covers, develop \nand approve the art early as color printing on custom stock \noften requires more time. Figure 4 shows examples of good \nproposal covers.\nFigure 4. Prepare a Custom Proposal Cover. The cover is the first thing the customer and evaluators will see when considering your proposal, \nso make it attractive and customer-focused. Even electronic submissions should include a custom cover. As you develop your proposal cover, \nuse images that convey what product or service you are proposing to the customer. A cover can be used effectively to draw the reader in for \nproposals submitted in person or electronically.\nOn smaller proposals, prepare a custom cover in one of the \nfollowing inexpensive ways:\n•\t Cut a page from one of your marketing brochures, then \noverprint the proposal title text.\n•\t Consider using some of the customer’s materials for \nthe cover, especially if you can directly connect those \nmaterials to your offer.\n•\t Create your own cover, print on heavier stock, then \nlaminate.\nUse quality binders. Economizing \non binders is false economy and \nhigh risk.\nConsider how proposals with \nmultiple volumes will be packaged for shipment. Consider \nindividually wrapping each binder to reduce damage and to \nprevent binders from opening during shipment.\nIf missing the submittal deadline means automatic \ndisqualification, plan a backup delivery system. International \nproposals increase delivery problems. While reducing delivery \nproblems, in-country production can lead to other potentially \ngreater problems:\n•\t Skilled editors and proofers may not be available.\n•\t Content can be altered.\n•\t Expenses increase if final reviewers must work in-country.\n•\t Security may be compromised.\nConsider requirements for electronic submittal, or some \ncombination of paper documents, electronic submittal, online \nportal, and an oral proposal. Regardless of the medium and \nsubmittal procedure, adapt the design to the medium while \naligning the message and content. Inconsistencies interject \ndoubt, distrust, and reduce your win probability.\nSee ELECTRONIC SUBMITTAL, \nINTERNATIONAL PROPOSALS, \nORAL PROPOSALS, and PAGE \nAND DOCUMENT DESIGN.\n\nProduction\nShipley Proposal Guide\n211\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nMAINTAIN A SECURE MASTER BOOK OF HARD-COPY FILES BACKED  \nBY ELECTRONIC FILES.\nMaintain a master book containing copies of all material in the \nlatest, approved version. All contributors must accept that none \nof their work is complete until it is inserted in the master book. \nThe master book can take several forms. Most are kept in ring \nbinders by the proposal specialist, production manager, or \nproposal manager. When material is revised, the new material \nis inserted in the binder; the previous version is placed in a \nbackup file ordered by section and date.\nInsist on getting electronic files with all hard copy submittals. \nStore them on a server that is frequently backed up or in secure \ncloud storage. Ensure that all contributors insert their name, \nsection number and name, date, time, and page number in the \nfooter of every page.\nThe master book is also used to check the printed copies. Turn \nthrough each printed page to confirm pages are not missing or \nprinted blank.\n8\t\nDILIGENTLY ENFORCE VERSION CONTROL ON A SECTION-BY-SECTION BASIS.\nEnforce version control to prevent more than one person \nfrom making changes on the same material in different files. \nProposal contributors inadvertently lose files. The potential \nfor problems with multiple versions of files increases with the \nnumber of contributors on the proposal team.\nAssign version control to one person on a section-by-section \nbasis. Normally, writers have version control through the initial \nreviews of their content. Once version \ncontrol is passed to the proposal or \nproduction coordinator, insist that all \nsuggested changes be made outside of \nthe master document and submitted \nseparately, usually electronically. \nOnline document collaboration tools are useful but require \ntraining and monitoring to avoid confusion.\nUse the electronic \nversion control features \nof different software \napplications. Features \nvary and are not \ndiscussed in this Guide.\n9\t\nINCREASE YOUR QUALITY CHECKS AND PRODUCTION TIME IF PROPOSAL  \nPRODUCTION IS REMOTE.\nRemote production could mean in another building, another \ncity, or another country. Each presents different challenges.\nWhenever possible, have one person from the proposal team \npresent at the print location during heavy production to \nanswer questions and detect errors early.\nFront load production by printing components or sections \nearly. Components that can be printed early include covers, \ntabs, inserts, foldouts, and appended materials. \nPrint individual sections as they are approved. Early print \noptions include resumes, past performance, management, \nand the executive summary.\nInternational production invites special problems:\n•\t Software, hardware, printers, keyboards, spelling or \ngrammar checkers, and paper quality may vary.\n•\t Paper size may be A4 versus 8.5 x 11 inches.\n•\t Ring binders change in number and size.\n•\t Translation can create further delays and the need for an \nadditional review.\n•\t Language dialects vary.\nPrinters do have equipment breakdowns, so identify a  \nbackup printer.\nSee ELECTRONIC \nSUBMITTAL and \nINTERNATIONAL \nPROPOSALS.\n\nProofreading, Editing, and Revising\nShipley Proposal Guide\n212\n©Shipley Associates\nPROOFREADING, EDITING, AND REVISING\nCustomers interpret proposals and other \nbusiness development documents as \nrepresenting your best effort. If they find \nerrors, they may doubt the accuracy of the rest of the proposal. \nMost editing, revising, and proofreading is done using \ntechnology and electronic tools. However, a careful review of \nthe actual hard copy of the proposal provides a different view \nof the document and can often surface unseen, electronic \nerrors or omissions. \nIf your proposal goes through a Red Team Review (final draft \nreview), the team may have several suggestions for improving \nthe overall content, tone, and message of the proposal.  \nParticipants in this review are encouraged to do more than \nidentify errors, omissions, or weaknesses; they should offer \nspecific suggestions for improvement. \nProposals go through several iterations and reviews before final submission to the customer. Careful and thorough proofreading, \nediting, and revising help you focus on complying with customer requirements and convey a clear sales message.\nSee COLOR \nTEAM REVIEWS.\nPROOFREADING, EDITING, AND REVISING\nReview the proposal for clarity and accuracy.\nEdit the proposal for conciseness at the \nsection, paragraph, and sentence levels.\nRevise the proposal for customer focus, compliance, \nand messaging.\n1\n2\n3\nLimit the number of editors or reviewers.\n4\nUse team members who are less familiar with the \nproposal message to provide unbiased feedback.\nLeave adequate time to make necessary \nadjustments.\nLeverage technology, including spell check, \ngrammar check, and readability tools.\n5\n6\n7\n1\t\nREVIEW THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY AND ACCURACY.\nMake sure your message is clear, bold, \nand obvious. Tackle the major issues of \norganization, customer focus, and strategy first.\nWhen reviewing for clarity, attempt to be so clear in what you \nwrite that you cannot possibly be misunderstood. Clarity is \naided by using repetition without being redundant. In other \nwords, refer to the same ideas with consistent terminology.\nWrite informative headings to highlight subordinate points in \nyour proposal. Informative headings allow evaluators to scan \nyour proposal and understand all your key points quickly. \nSee HEADINGS.\n\nProofreading, Editing, and Revising\nShipley Proposal Guide\n213\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nEDIT THE PROPOSAL FOR CONCISENESS AT THE SECTION, PARAGRAPH,  \nAND SENTENCE LEVELS.\nEdit paragraphs, sentences, and words so your text is as \ncompact and efficient as possible. Begin with paragraphs \nso they say what is necessary and nothing else. Continue \nby editing and revising sentences to eliminate unnecessary \nphrases. Finish by substituting the shortest, most \nunderstandable words that do not alter your meaning. \nEliminate everything that doesn’t directly support the \npurposes of the proposal. \nParagraphs should be short and easily digestible. Edit and \ncheck paragraphs for topicality and length by following  \nthese concepts:\n•\t Have only one main idea per paragraph. Simple ideas \nproduce shorter paragraphs, because you are not \nstruggling to reconcile competing thoughts.\n•\t Begin with a sentence that states the main idea.\n•\t Organize information within the paragraph from general \nto specific, from benefits to features, and from familiar \nto unfamiliar. Such obvious relationships require less \nexplanation and will produce more concise paragraphs.\n•\t Be sure that paragraphs flow logically. Diversions require \njustification; straightforward progressions do not.\n•\t Use transitions to show connections to previous and \nfollowing paragraphs. Stating the relationship between \nparagraphs allows thoughts from one to carry over to \nanother without having to be repeated.\n•\t Consider breaking long paragraphs, even if they contain \nonly one main idea.\n•\t Look for ways to emphasize benefits to the customer \nthroughout the proposal.\nAfter editing the paragraph as a whole, shift focus to the \nsentence level:\n•\t Use active voice. \n•\t Eliminate compound sentences.\n•\t Avoid subordinate clauses unless they shorten  \nthe sentence or paragraph.\n•\t Use strong verbs.\n•\t Avoid false subjects.\n•\t Be as direct as possible.\n•\t Search for prepositions as markers for possible  \nwordy phrases.\nWhen your paragraphs and sentences are more concise, edit \nand revise individual words. Simplify words whenever possible \nand use the shortest, correct word. If you can remove a word \nwithout changing the meaning, do so.\nMost business development writing is too long. A concise \nproposal allows you to directly focus on what you will do or \nprovide for the customer.\nSee ACTIVE/\nPASSIVE \nVOICE.\nSimple, telegraphic headings merely announce the subject \nmatter of a section. Informative headings tell the reader what \nto expect.\nBe correct, not just with mechanics of spelling, punctuation, \nand grammar, but with your facts. Consult references to ensure \nthe facts, historical references, arithmetic, or background \ninformation you have included are actually true. Your \ncredibility is at stake, and if it suffers, your readers will either \ndisbelieve you or simply stop reading. \nParagraphs \nshould \nbe short \nand easily \ndigestible. \n“ \n”\n\nProofreading, Editing, and Revising\nShipley Proposal Guide\n214\n©Shipley Associates\nDuring the final revision, check for \ncustomer focus, compliance, and \nmessaging. These three concepts are \npowerful tools that ensure your proposal conveys what the \ncustomer is looking for.\nAnswer the following questions as you review your proposal \nfor customer focus:\n•\t Have you cited the customer’s hot buttons?\n•\t Do you name the customer before your company?\n•\t Do you name the customer as many or more times than \nyourself?\nA proposal may be rejected if it does not meet the specified \nrequirements. Before you submit, review your compliance \nchecklist and response matrix to ensure you have answered \neach of the customer’s requirements and questions. \nSimplify the evaluators’ job by preparing a compliance \nresponse locator with your proposal, similar to the one shown \nin figure 1. This will allow the evaluator to quickly and simply \nconfirm you have answered each requirement. Verify that \nthe sections referenced in the compliance response locator \nactually answer the requirement listed. \nRevise your proposal to be sure your message to the customer \nis consistent. The wording, tone, and graphics should support \nyour overall message of your win theme and answer the \nquestion “Why us?”  Your proposal sections should flow \nsmoothly with clear transitions to link your message in one \nsection with the others.

Use this time to make necessary adjustments. \nDepending on how much time is left before the proposal \ndeadline, determine which recommendations are necessary \nand feasible. If reviewers feel that your past performance \nexamples do not clearly relate to the \ncurrent customer, you may not have \ntime to rewrite an entire section, but you can adjust wording to \nincrease customer focus.\nAllowing enough time to make necessary adjustments reduces \nfrantic, last-minute rewrites. \n4\t\nLIMIT THE NUMBER OF EDITORS OR REVIEWERS.\nWhile some may think the more eyes on a proposal the \nbetter the final product will be, keep the number of reviewers \nreasonable. Too much feedback can tempt proposal \ncontributors to make drastic changes to the proposal when \nthere is little time to do so. \nDetermine how many reviewers or editors are necessary. This \nmay vary depending on the size of the proposal and the time \navailable. Having too many editors increases the chance of \nconflicting suggestions.\n5\t\n USE TEAM MEMBERS WHO ARE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPOSAL MESSAGE \nTO PROVIDE UNBIASED FEEDBACK.\nYou should seek input from many different perspectives, \nand fresh eyes are essential to avoiding bias. If you give a \ndraft summary to colleagues on the proposal team, they \nwill already know the story and the strategy, including the \ndetails. You run the risk of their reading between the lines \nand thinking the draft is fine when in fact it may be missing \nkey aspects of the win strategy or customer focus.\nWithin your organization, you should be able to find people \nwho will have similar perspectives and levels of knowledge \nto what you expect in the customer’s organization. Recruit \nreviewers with the same outlook and background based on \ncustomer analysis performed during proposal preparation. \nSome suggestions on who might be helpful are listed below:\n•\t Upper management\n•\t Program manager\n•\t Account manager \n•\t Technical and/or solutions lead\n•\t Marketing representative\n•\t Contracts specialist\n•\t Legal counsel\n•\t Teammate (as applicable)\n6\t\n LEAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO MAKE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS. \nSee SCHEDULING.\n7\t\nLEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING SPELL CHECK, GRAMMAR CHECK,  \nAND READABILITY TOOLS.\nIf the program you used to write the proposal is already \nequipped with spell and grammar check tools, use them. If \ntools are not available through your software, consider  \nusing an online tool to check for spelling, grammar, and \nreadability mistakes. \nOften, running spell and grammar check can correct small \nerrors that could impact the customer’s view of your offer and \ncompany. A computer finds mistakes a lot faster than an editor, \nso use this to your advantage. However, know that some spell \ncheckers will not recognize every error, so always conduct with \na personal read-through.\nIn cases where a second language is involved, readability and \nspell/grammar reviews should be completed by an individual \nfluent in the native language of the customer or evaluator.\n\nProposal Management Plan\nShipley Proposal Guide\n216\n©Shipley Associates\nPROPOSAL MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEstablish direction, then velocity. \nMany proposal managers start holding \ntoo many meetings with writers and \nmanagers before planning is complete. \nThe result is wasted effort, conflicts, and \nloss of commitment to a quality effort.\nGuideline 5 in this section outlines \nthe contents of an effective PMP. All \nrelevant schedules, deadlines, action \nitems, and instructions must be kept \ncurrent in the PMP.\nSave time by extracting and adapting content from the \ncapture plan and opportunity plan with direction from the \naccount executive. The PMP should include an overview of the \ncustomer, the opportunity, and the overall win strategy.\nProposal Management Plans (PMPs) document the roles, responsibilities, tasks, schedules, deliverables, and deadlines \nthroughout the entire proposal development process.\nWhile a PMP is \ndescribed as a single \ndocument, most \nPMPs are a series of \ndocuments or files that \nare prepared, posted, \nshared, and repeatedly \nupdated on a secure \nwebsite. Use this virtu-\nal, shared-document \napproach, especially \nwhen team members \nare virtual and not \nco-located.\nPROPOSAL MANAGEMENT PLAN\nAlways prepare a Proposal Management Plan.\nComplete and review the PMP prior \nto the kickoff meeting.\nDistribute the PMP at the kickoff meeting.\n1\n2\n3\nKeep the PMP current, \nand manage to the plan.\nDevelop a PMP template \nfor your organization.\n4\n5\n\nProposal Management Plan\nShipley Proposal Guide\n217\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nALWAYS PREPARE A PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT PLAN.\nPreparing a Proposal Management Plan (PMP) is a proven best \npractice that leads to improved win rates and higher quality \nproposals produced with less frustration and cost. When you \ndo not have time to prepare multiple drafts, always prepare \nthe fundamental elements of a PMP.\nMany commercial sector proposal plans begin in a conference \ncall termed the proposal kickoff, which is at best a loosely \norganized planning meeting. At a minimum, develop a \nstrawman PMP before the conference call or web conference.\n2\t\nCOMPLETE AND REVIEW THE PMP PRIOR TO THE KICKOFF MEETING.\nEffective core proposal team preparation, prior to a kickoff \nmeeting, requires developing three documents:\n1.\t Proposal Management Plan\n2.\t Draft Executive Summary\n3.\t Proposal Kickoff Package\nReview the PMP with management and key stakeholders to \nget their buy-in and endorsement. If they are not willing to \nsupport the effort as outlined, you must change the plan or \nreview your bid decision.\nIf you must call a kickoff meeting prior to \ncompleting the PMP, advise contributors \nthat they will be given clear assignments \nlater. Set the date for the meeting, and ask \ncontributors to clear their schedules.\nSee EXECUTIVE  \nSUMMARY, KICKOFF \nMEETINGS, and  \nPROCESS for a  \ndiscussion of the  \nother tools, events,  \nand milestones.\n3\t\nDISTRIBUTE THE PMP AT THE KICKOFF MEETING.\nThe PMP is your plan for the entire effort. Distributing the PMP \nclarifies everyone’s tasks and engenders confidence that their \nefforts are well-managed and supported by management. \nA well-conceived PMP suggests that you are not wasting \ncontributors’ time.\nIf your PMP comprises files or lists posted on a secure website, \nthen distribution entails communicating and confirming that \ncontributors can access that site. Then, confirm that they do \naccess that site.\nYour complete kickoff meeting package includes five items:\n•\t PMP\n•\t Storyboard forms with win themes\n•\t Writing template and section guides\n•\t Cross-reference and compliance matrices\n•\t Draft proposal executive summary\nA kickoff meeting without a PMP is a missed opportunity to \neffectively lead a proposal effort.\n4\t\nKEEP THE PMP CURRENT AND MANAGE TO THE PLAN.\nReflect changes in the RFP, dates, schedules, and contributors \nby updating the PMP. Not including external changes, avoid \nsliding completion dates. Manage to the plan.\nWhether your PMP is a physical or electronic document or \nseries of documents, post the most recent version on the \nteam website. Instruct contributors to set up automatic \nnotifications to alert them when documents are modified \nand new files are posted.\n\nProposal Management Plan\nShipley Proposal Guide\n218\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nDEVELOP A PMP TEMPLATE FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION.\nAdapt the format and contents of a PMP to the complexity of \nthe proposal, the size of the proposal team, the value of the \nproposal, and the experience and skills of the managers and \ncontributors.\nThe minimum contents of a PMP are summarized in figure 1. \nThis information can reside in a template, a spreadsheet, or on \na collaborative online workspace.\nP M P  C O N T E N T S\n1.\t Customer Profile and Key Issues\n2.\t Competitive Analysis\n3.\t Staffing Roles and Responsibilities\n4.\t Defined Proposal Operations\n5.\t Type of Contract\n6.\t Printer Information and Locations\n7.\t Building or Room Security Restrictions\nA R T I F A C T S\nA.\tCompliance Matrix\nB.\tProposal Schedule\nC.\tProposal Outline\nD.\tWriters’ Information\nE.\tProposal Strategy and Themes\nF.\t Draft Executive Summary\nG.\tWork Breakdown Structure (WBS) and \nWBS Dictionary\nH.\tFile Repository\nFigure 1.

Your PMP should perform the following \nfunctions:\n•\t Provide the proposal team with the big picture.\n•\t Keep management and contributors informed                      \nof progress.\n•\t Convey and manage tasks, expectations, and quality \nstandards.\n•\t Provide consistent information and strategies to entire \nteam.\n•\t Reduce redundancy and waste.\n\nProposal Preparation Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n219\n©Shipley Associates\nPROPOSAL PREPARATION TOOLS\nEfficiency tools help you prepare proposals faster. They \ncan save time and improve consistency. Typically software, \nefficiency tools include knowledge management, document \nmanagement, workflow management, collaboration, bid \nrequest stripping, estimating, \nintegrated design, and pricing \ntools.\nEffectiveness tools help \nyou prepare proposals with \nbetter content. Whether \nelectronic or paper-based, \neffectiveness tools improve \nusers’ conceptual thinking \nand process consistency resulting in more customer-focused, \nresponsive, and persuasive proposals. Effectiveness tools \ntake time to use but ultimately save time by eliminating \nunnecessary or iterative tasks. Effectiveness tools include \nmilestone checklists, decision matrices, proposal management \nplans, bidder comparison charts, strategy statement \ntemplates, section organizers, storyboards, and oral proposal \nplanners.\nUse both efficiency and effectiveness tools. Define proposal \nquality standards, thoroughly train users on both types of \ntools, and then manage to your standards. \nThe following guidelines will help you analyze, select, and \nuse the best efficiency and effectiveness tools for your \norganization. \nNote: These guidelines do not recommend specific tools \nbecause users’ needs and tools frequently change.\nSome tools improve both \nefficiency and effectiveness. An \nefficiency tool might incorpo-\nrate conceptual prompts.\nMany of the tools discussed \napply to business development \nand capture management, not \njust proposal preparation.\nPROPOSAL PREPARATION TOOLS\nIntegrate proposal preparation tools into your \ndefined business development process.\nManage to meet clearly defined, measurable \nquality standards.\nUse both efficiency and effectiveness tools.\n1\n2\n3\nTrain users to think conceptually about the purpose \nof the tools and then how to apply the tool.\n4\nLink tool outputs to other tool inputs.\nReexamine your tools and quality standards \nif your success metrics do not improve.\nDesignate a process owner to collect metrics, foster \ncontinuous improvement, maintain tools, and \nmaintain support infrastructure.\n5\n6\n7\nProposal preparation tools help you prepare proposals more efficiently and effectively. Using the correct tool to capture, \nanalyze, and manipulate information can decrease rework, reduce preparation costs, and increase win rates.\n\nProposal Preparation Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n220\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nINTEGRATE PROPOSAL PREPARATION TOOLS INTO YOUR DEFINED BUSINESS \nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS.\nTo use any type of proposal \npreparation tool effectively, your \norganization must define and \ncommit to follow a single, flexible, \nand scalable process. Consider \nhow business development best \npractices are thwarted by poor use of good tools:\n•\t Make sound bid decisions. A tool that helps you rapidly \nassemble reuse material into proposals is wasted if \ncustomers have minimal interest in buying from your \norganization or the material is not directly relevant to the \nservices sought. \n•\t Appoint an individual at the executive level to maintain \nbroad management support. A tool that helps you \nprepare a capture plan is wasted if no one is committed \nto review, execute, and monitor the strategies and tactics \ndefined in the plan.\n•\t Focus on the customer’s issues throughout the sales \nprocess. A tool that helps writers rapidly identify \npotentially relevant material is wasted if management \nand writers do not know how to tailor and link that \nmaterial to the customer’s issues, the competitive \nsituation, and your sales strategy.\nWhen good tools are used poorly and bids are lost, users \nand management often blame the tool. Instead, define your \nbusiness development process, including the tools.\nSee CAPTURE/OPPORTU-\nNITY PLANNING, PROPOS-\nAL MANAGEMENT PLAN, \nPROCESS, PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT DESIGN, and \nPROPOSAL STRATEGY.\n2\t\nMANAGE TO MEET CLEARLY DEFINED, MEASURABLE QUALITY STANDARDS.\nIf you manage to meet clearly defined, measurable, proposal \nquality standards, you can determine if a tool is used \neffectively, misused, or needs to be modified or supplemented. \nFor example, no matter how well-written, \nmaterial reused from a previous proposal \ncannot specifically address this customer’s \nissues. The best you can do is address typical issues of typical \ncustomers. \nBoilerplate proposals are seldom effective because they are \nnot customer-focused. Consider this common situation: \nCompany X purchases proposal preparation software that helps writ-\ners identify, select, and insert potentially relevant reuse material into \na word processing file. Their template defines styles for theme state-\nments, action captions, headings, summaries, introductions, bullet \nlists, callouts, success stories, and even reserves a wide left margin for \nemphasis devices. However, if nothing is placed in the left margin, the \ncustomer’s perception is that Company X has nothing worth empha-\nsizing. Alternatively, if the left-margin callouts comprise bland, me-too \nclaims, this reflects adversely on Company X, as well.\nTools can actually reduce proposal quality if the writers do \nnot know the quality standards and management does not \nunderstand and enforce these standards. Defining standards \nis the first step in measuring the contribution of your proposal \npreparation tools.\nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS.\n3\t\nUSE BOTH EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS TOOLS. \nEfficiency tools save time, helping you \ncomplete tasks faster. Effectiveness tools help \nyou complete the right tasks better. Organizations that use \nboth effectiveness and efficiency tools gain the most.\nUse effectiveness tools to eliminate wasted effort, reduce \nrework, and improve output quality. Use the efficiency tools to \nsave time. Various tools and tool benefits are listed in figure 1.\nSee MODEL \nDOCUMENTS.\n\nProposal Preparation Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n221\n©Shipley Associates\nEFFICIENCY TOOL\nTOOL BENEFITS\nKnowledge Management\nLabel, store, search, identify, and retrieve reusable information\nWorkflow Management\nIdentify, define, schedule, and manage project tasks\nCollaboration\nHelp individuals work and contribute productively in virtual teams\nBid Request Parser\nIdentify, extract, group, and assign compliance requirements to contributors\nIntegrated Design & Pricing\nAutomatically determine individual task price and total solution price at each design step\nEstimating \nExtend and roll up total solution price; test alternative pricing strategies\nEFFECTIVENESS TOOL\nTOOL BENEFITS\nMilestone Checklists\nImprove quality and consistency of milestone decisions\nDecision Matrices \nImprove quality and consistency of decisions\nCapture/Opportunity Plans\nPosition organization as preferred provider before proposal submittal\nProposal Management Plans\nBetter organization of information to prepare a better proposal at lower cost\nBidder Comparison Matrices\nBetter assess competitive position; improve teaming analysis; identify discriminators\nStrategy Statement Templates\nImprove clarity and implementation of strategy\nSection Organizers\nImprove customer focus and clarity of written documents and oral presentations\nStoryboards\nReduce rewrites and improve proposal quality\nOral Proposal Planners\nImprove presentation effectiveness; align presentation with the proposal\nFigure 1. Consider Efficiency and Effectiveness Tools. Both classes of proposal preparation tools offer benefits but require significant  \ntraining and monitoring.\n4\t\nTRAIN USERS TO THINK CONCEPTUALLY ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE TOOL  \nAND THEN HOW TO APPLY THE TOOL. \nRote manipulation of a tool yields mediocre results. Consider \nthese questions:\n•\t How can proposal managers prepare a proposal strategy \nwithout a prior sales or capture strategy?\n•\t How can proposal writers preparing a storyboard draft a \nsection theme statement without understanding features, \nadvantages, benefits, and theme statement standards?\n•\t How can proposal writers effectively tailor reuse materials \nwithout understanding the customer’s needs, your \nstrategy, and fundamentals of organization?\n•\t How can account executives use section organizers to \nconceive and mock up executive summaries if they have \nnever been trained to use them?\nWithout a conceptual framework, tool users are simply \noperating a piece of software or completing a form. Garbage \nin; garbage out.\nThe most effective training is tailored to the market and \norganization. Ask participants to use the tool during training, \nand then offer constructive suggestions for improvement. Just \nshowing them how it works is a waste of time, even if it requires \nless training. Then reinforce the training with activities based \nupon the review of their work products.\nAvoid these common training errors:\n•\t Call a meeting, position the new tool as the means to \nsolve a problem, have an expert user demonstrate the \ntool, then give everyone the tool and expect expert use.\n•\t Call a training session, ignore the trainer’s \nrecommendations on how to train users because, Our \npeople are smarter, more skilled than the average user, \nand then cut training time in half. \n•\t Assume everyone enters training with the same level of \nunderstanding. For example, a tool built in Excel often \nrequires reasonable knowledge of Excel. A scheduling tool \nthat outputs to project planning software requires both \nthe software and how to use that software.\n•\t Assume everyone will get it in a single session.\n•\t Fail to train the managers, who will not understand the \ntool or how to review tool output.\n•\t Leave experts unfamiliar with the tool and inherent \nassumptions who will then distrust and not use the tool.\n\nProposal Preparation Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n222\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nLINK TOOL OUTPUTS TO OTHER TOOL INPUTS.\nLink your tools. Outputs or products of one tool should be the \ninput to another tool in your business development process. \nNo one wants to fill in a box or complete a field just because it \nexists. Professionals must be convinced that their actions are \nuseful to themselves, or secondarily, to others.\nFor example: \nA global SaaS organization developed a comprehensive series of tem-\nplates to support their sales process. When asked how the output was \nlinked to another template, the tool developer and sales managers \nadmitted: This data is not used elsewhere, but it is nice to know. The \ncompany’s sales executives seldom used any of the templates, and \ntheir sales managers never asked to see completed templates. Yet, \nall account executives insisted that they followed their organization’s \ndefined sales process but did not use the forms. \nLinking your proposal preparation tools has three major \nbenefits, in order of importance:\n•\t Improves coordination and hand-off between sales and \nsales support groups. How often does your field sales \nteam complain about the quality of proposals prepared \nby sales support? How often does sales support say they \nknow little about the customer and the sales strategy?\n•\t Improves communication of key sales points in the \nproposal. How often have you seen vital storyboard data \nomitted from the section draft? How often is a key sales \npoint omitted from the proposal?\n•\t Saves time. Transferring data manually from one field or \nform to another is nearly as frustrating as entering data \nthat is not used. \n6\t\nREEXAMINE YOUR TOOLS AND QUALITY STANDARDS IF YOUR SUCCESS METRICS \nDO NOT IMPROVE.\nValid reasons to use any tool are \nto improve results and save time. \nReexamine your process and quality \nstandards if your success metrics do not \nimprove after adopting a new tool. \nTwo of the most commonly collected metrics are win rate and \ncapture ratio. Tools can contribute to these metrics.\nWin rates tell you little about whether you are winning the \nmost important opportunities. Capture ratio is a better \nmeasure of process and tool effectiveness because large bids, \nwhich are likely to be more competitive, carry a greater weight. \nWhen organizations have higher win rates than capture ratios, \nthey are likely winning more of the small, less competitive \ncompetitions. When organizations’ capture ratios exceed \ntheir win rate, they are usually winning more of the larger \ncompetitions.\nComparing win rates and capture ratios between organizations \nis unreliable because organizations track win rates and \ncapture ratios differently. Consider tracking seven categories \nof won-lost data: Won, lost, no-bid, cancelled (by customer), \nwithdrawn (by bidder), pending, and unknown. Then:\nOrganizations can broadly assess the effectiveness of their \nprocesses and tools by collecting trailing, diagnostic, and \nleading metrics. Trailing indicators, such as win rates and \ncapture ratio, are the easiest to collect and tell you how you \ndid. Diagnostic metrics, such as the customer focus indicators \ndiscussed in Customer Focus, indicate process or tool-use \ndeficiencies. \nMany purported measures of process and tool effectiveness \nmeasure activity but not effectiveness. Consider this example:\nCompany A invests $X in knowledge management, boilerplate \nidentification and retrieval, and proposal preparation software. They \nprepared and submitted 400 proposals this year, up from 200 proposals \nthe prior year, using 20 percent fewer sales support personnel. \nCompany A appears to have reduced their proposal preparation costs \nmore than half and shortened preparation time, achieving the return \non investment promised by the software vendor.\nSee PROCESS for \nmore on using \nprocess gate reviews \nto manage capture \neffectiveness.\n=  W I N   R AT E\n#  O F B I D S  W O N\n#  O F B I D S  S U B M I T T E D\n  C A P T U R E  \t\n  R AT I O\n$  VA LU E  O F B I D S  W O N\n$  VA LU E  O F B I D S \nS U B M I T T E D\n=\nO P P O RT U N I T I E S  W O N\nTotal Opportunities Submitted \nminus Pending, Withdrawn, Can-\ncelled, and Unknown opportuntites.\nW I N  R AT E =\n\nProposal Preparation Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n223\n©Shipley Associates\nBut did Company A invest wisely? Did their win rate increase, \nstay the same, or decrease? What happened to their capture \nratio? And even if these measures worsened, the cause could \nbe poor use of the tool in a defective process rather than a \npoor tool.\nIf you want to assess the effectiveness of your proposal \npreparation tools, assess the improvement in your results. \nWhile many factors contribute to capture effectiveness, \nisolated measures of activity, such as person-hours per \nproposal, tell you little about tool effectiveness.\n7\t\nDESIGNATE A PROCESS OWNER TO COLLECT METRICS, FOSTER CONTINUOUS \nIMPROVEMENT, MAINTAIN TOOLS, AND MAINTAIN SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. \nProcesses erode quickly without a process owner. Process \nowners collect metrics to focus attention on key practices \nand to quantify improvements in the business development \nprocess. \nTo remain effective, your business development processes and \ntools must be maintained. To keep your processes and support \ntools synchronized, assign maintenance responsibility to the \nsame person. \nMany proposal managers develop effective tools, use them \npersonally, and share them with colleagues. Subsequently, \ncolleagues modify the tool, impair the functionality, and \nbecome frustrated. In addition, repeated software and \noperating system updates impair functionality, and the \noriginal developer is unavailable and no one understands the \nimplicit assumptions and operation.\nVendors are increasingly offering proposal development \ntools on their websites. Use these tools if you understand the \nimplicit assumptions and can confirm that these assumptions \napply to this proposal and your organization.\nEstablish a tool review interval. Make sure the tool is accurate, \nadds value, and is being used. Review the accuracy of your \nboilerplate two to four times annually. Set an expiration date \non each boilerplate item. Either remove expired boilerplate, \nwarn users it might be incorrect, or mark it expired. \nMany organizations have invested in tools that promised to \nsave time but did not improve effectiveness. Evaluate the \neffectiveness of tool output, as illustrated in \nthese examples:\nA process owner uses a knowledge management tool to archive and \nretrieve boilerplate and to measure writers’ productivity in pages per \nday. As a result, writers insert more boilerplate, appearing to increase \nproductivity. Consider adding measures of quality, customer focus, \ncompliance, win rates, or direct customer feedback.\nA process owner measures the number of proposals issued to gauge \nsales force and proposal center productivity. The organization pur-\nchased proposal preparation software to improve the productivity \nof both groups. Subsequently, the number of proposals written and \nsubmitted doubled, but sales revenue remained flat as win rates \ndropped. \nWhile the software may be effective, review the organization’s \npursuit and bid decision discipline. To win more business, use \nboth effectiveness and efficiency tools in a defined business \ndevelopment process.\nSee PROCESS.\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n224\n©Shipley Associates\nPROPOSAL STRATEGY\nTo win business most effectively, align your business, market, \ncapture, sales, and proposal strategies and tactics. Misaligned \nstrategies reflect in your proposal and prompt customers to \ndoubt your messages.\nThis section discusses proposal strategy as a subset of  \nthe capture and sales strategy. For a full discussion of  \ncapture strategy, refer to Win Strategy Development in  \nthe Capture Guide.\nPROPOSAL STRATEGY\nDistinguish capture/sales strategy and \nproposal strategy.\nDefine and agree to use common definitions of terms.\nIdentify the economic buyer, the influencers, and the \ntechnical buyers; then list their issues.\n1\n2\n3\nUse a Power Rating to meld individual buyers’ \nissues into a set of organizational issues.\n4\nPrepare a Bidder Comparison Chart to discern how \nthe customer organization perceives your solution \nversus competitive solutions.\nIdentify your value proposition and how you will \npresent it in your proposal.\nDraft specific strategy statements that define both \nwhat you will do and how you will implement them.\n6\n7\n8\nUse trade-offs to validate your approach and \nghost the competition.\n9\n1\t\nDISTINGUISH CAPTURE/SALES STRATEGY AND PROPOSAL STRATEGY.\nProposal strategy is a plan to write a persuasive, compelling, and winning proposal. Proposal strategy is a subset of \ncapture and sales strategy.\nUse an Integrated Solution Worksheet to arrive \nat a competitive solution that is aligned with the \ncustomer’s issues and requirements.\n5\nStrategy might be the most overused word in business. \nStrategy might refer to a position, an action, the entire \nsolution, an aspect of the solution, or a favorite catch phrase \nor slogan.\nTo craft and present an aligned message, all members of \nthe selling team must agree to use a common process and \ncommon definitions:\n•\t Business strategy is an organization’s plan to achieve \noverall business objectives.\n•\t Market strategy is an organization’s plan to achieve \nspecific market objectives, typically involving multiple \nsales channels.\n•\t Capture/sales strategy is the actionable plan to win a \nspecific, defined opportunity.\n•\t Sales strategy should be identical to a capture strategy; \ni.e., opportunity specific, but sales strategy has been used \nso generically that the term was not used in the Capture \nGuide or Proposal Guide.\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n225\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nDEFINE AND AGREE TO USE COMMON DEFINITIONS OF TERMS.\nThree of the most universally used and misunderstood terms \nrelating to strategy are issues, motivators, and hot buttons. \nThe relationship of these three terms is illustrated in figure 1 \nand defined as follows:\nIssues are the customer’s concerns. Issues are the worry items \nthat keep the customer awake at night.\nMotivators are the objectives that the customer is trying to \nachieve:\n•\t Improve profits\n•\t Increase sales\n•\t Reduce costs\n•\t Improve safety\n•\t Reduce risk\n•\t Improve quality\nHot buttons are a consolidated set of issues and motivators, \npreferably two to five items. State hot buttons using the \ncustomer’s words. \nMost motivators are issues, but not all issues are motivators. \nFor example, training could be an example of a hot button \nthat is an issue but not a motivator. Few customers are \nmotivated to buy because they get to attend training. However, \nif users were poorly trained on a previous similar purchase \nand problems ensued, \nthen training could be a \ncustomer’s hot button. \nYour proposal strategy \nshould be based on the \nunderlying customer hot \nbuttons.\nFigure 1. The Relationship among Issues, Motivators, and Hot \nButtons. Hot buttons are mostly motivators but could also include a \nsmall number of issues that are not motivators. Focusing on customer \nhot buttons is a key aspect of proposal strategy.\nConcerns that the seller has about a \nsolution or approach are called gaps, \nthe difference between what the cus-\ntomer wants and what the seller can \noffer. Issues are owned by the custom-\ner, not the seller. Avoid the confusion \ncaused by mingling customer\ngaps and seller issues.\n•\t Proposal strategy is a plan to write a persuasive, \ncompelling, and winning proposal. The proposal strategy \nis a subset of the capture strategy. The message is the \nsame; only the tactical aspects of implementation differ.\n•\t Win strategy is often used to describe the overarching \nactions required to win an opportunity. In reality, \ncapture strategy and win strategy are identical, but some \npractitioners have opted to limit capture strategy to the \nspecific positioning actions of the capture team.\nFirst, prepare the capture/sales strategy, and then prepare the \nproposal strategy. If you lack a capture/sales strategy, you are \npoorly positioned to win and should consider not bidding.\nIn capture planning, you plan and take actions to convey \ninformation that persuades each customer to prefer, or at \nminimum, favorably regard your organization and solution. \nYour persuasive actions might comprise white papers, \npresentations, meetings, site visits, demonstrations, and \nmedia buys or events.\nIn a proposal, convey identical, aligned information in words, \ntext, and graphics. Hence, the proposal strategy evolves from \nthe capture strategy.\nThe proposal strategy articulates exactly how you will explain \nyour benefits and value to the customer. Guideline 8 in this \nsection gives specific guidance in developing your proposal \nstrategy.\nC\nu\ns\nt\no\nm\ne\nr\n \nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns\nM\no\nt\ni\nv\na\nt\no\nr\ns\nHot \nButtons\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n226\n©Shipley Associates\nKnowing the makeup of the customer buying team helps you \nfocus your proposal strategy on their needs.\nEconomic buyers are the individuals who give final approval \nto purchase. They sign the check and retain veto power. \nEconomic buyers tend to be \nconcerned about the trade-off \nbetween price and performance. \nThey focus on bottom-line impact. \nWhile many people may offer \ninput and recommendations, only \neconomic buyers can give final \napproval.\nInfluencers are the people who \nhave a potential impact on the \ndecision. Their personal success \nmay be affected by the sale, so their \nconcerns are often emotional and \nsubjective.\nInfluencers’ issues can include reliability, support, ease of \noperation, maintenance, safety, potential impact on morale, \nand potential impact on their personal success. Because they \noften supervise the use of your product or service, they can \ninfluence the decision.\nTechnical buyers are gatekeepers. They cannot give final \napproval, but they can give a final “No.” Technical buyers \noften determine the short list. They tend to focus on the \nfeatures of a product or service as measured against objective \nspecifications established to screen offers.\nTechnical buyers may not be technical in the scientific sense. \nPurchasing agents, lawyers, contracts people, and licensing or \nregulatory authorities are technical buyers. Because technical \nbuyers are primarily focused on how well you meet their \nscreening tests, the better you understand their criteria, the \nbetter your chances of getting their recommendations.\nAnother way to examine buyers is according to their source of \npower. Power could be economic, control (typically users), or \ntechnical. Or power could be by level of management, such as \nexecutive management, middle management, and operations.\nAfter identifying all the different types of buyers, list the issues \nof each individual  buyer. The most important issues of the \nentire organization are usually associated with a majority \nof the buyers. This helps you shape your win strategy and \nmessaging.\n3\t\nIDENTIFY THE ECONOMIC BUYER, THE INFLUENCERS, AND THE TECHNICAL  \nBUYERS; THEN LIST THEIR ISSUES.\nBuyer roles may overlap. \nFor example, the presi-\ndent of a small technical  \ncompany might be both \nthe economic and techni-\ncal buyer.\nSome sales professionals \nsay that there is only \none buyer, the individual \nempowered to make the \nfinal purchase decision. \nAll other types of buyers, \nsuch as users or technical \nbuyers, are called  \n“influencers.\n4\t\nUSE A POWER RATING TO MELD INDIVIDUAL BUYERS’ ISSUES INTO A SET  \nOF ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES.\nOne-on-one selling affords the opportunity to address \nindividuals’ issues. However, this is not possible when \nyou are preparing a proposal that will be evaluated by \nmultiple buyers. Combine individuals’ issues into a set \nof organizational issues that can be addressed in a single \nproposal or presentation.\nUse the Power Rating to determine the relative importance \nof the group’s issues. The Power Rating is the product of \nthe power of the individual buyer, the decision maker and \ninfluencers, times the relative importance of that issue to \neach individual.\nAs you develop your proposal strategy, use the template \nshown in figure 2 to produce a combined, weighted list \nof issues from the individual buyers’ issues. Then use this \nweighted list as the basis for the Bidder Comparison Chart, \ndiscussed in guideline 6.\nThe most important \nissues of the entire \norganization are \nusually associated \nwith a majority of the \nbuyers.\n“ \n”\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n227\n©Shipley Associates\n1\n   Positioning the Opportunity\n1.

Power Rating Calculation Shows Organizational Issues That Impact Your Strategy. Allocate a rating from 1–10 for the ‘Power’ \nthat each individual buyer has in the buying decision (1 = least influence; 10 = most influence). Then list the issues that concern each buyer and \nallocate an ‘Importance’ rating from 1–10 for each of these issues—the rating reflecting how important each issue is to that particular buyer. \nMultiply the ‘Power’ by the ‘Importance’ to give a ‘Power Rating’ for each issue; then group the issues together across multiple buyers and total \ntheir Power Ratings. Finally, choose the top 6–8 organizational issues and scale their scores so that they total 100.\n5\t\nUSE AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION WORKSHEET TO ARRIVE AT A  \nCOMPETITIVE SOLUTION THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE CUSTOMER’S ISSUES  \nAND REQUIREMENTS.\nThe Integrated Solution Worksheet (ISW) is a powerful analysis \ntool throughout the capture and sales process. The ISW is first \ndeveloped as part of the capture/opportunity plan. The ISW is \nshown in figure 3.\nIf your capture/opportunity plan includes an ISW, confirm \nthat it is current. If not, prepare the ISW to help shape your \nproposal strategy.\nIf the customer already has a solution in mind, as stated \nin meetings for unsolicited bids or in the bid request as \nrequirements, the ISW helps define the underlying issues \ndriving their requirements. Analyze your competitive position, \nthen work to favorably influence the requirements if the \nsolicitation has not been released.\nNext, extend your analysis to outline your solution, to outline \nyour  competition’s solution, and to identify discriminators. \nThen define the strategies and actions required to better \nposition your solution with the customer, discussed in \nguideline 8.\nFigure 3. Integrated Solution Worksheet Helps Shape Strategy. Begin by filling the “Issues” column when you are early in the process. If the \ncustomer has identified requirements, fill the “Requirements” column.

Update it during proposal \npreparation if the underlying information \nchanges. The Bidder Comparison Chart can be an excellent \ncustomer collaboration tool if you are permitted access to the \ncustomer. The chart is also an effective tool to use during a \nfacilitated win strategy session inside your organization.\nSee CAPTURE/\nOPPORTUNITY  \nPLANNING\nand EXECUTIVE  \nSUMMARY.\nISSUES\nWEIGHT\nUS (SCORE)\nCOMPANY A\nCOMPANY B\nSpecific Experience\nLow Price\nFamiliarity with Manager Named\nAbility to Meet Schedule\nTOTAL SCORE\nFigure 4. Bidder Comparison Chart Shows Strengths and Gaps in a Solution. First list the customer’s issues, then the relative weight of each \nissue as perceived by the customer. Establish the relative weight of each issue in one of three ways: (1) Use the customer’s evaluation criteria, \n(2) Assign a weight, forcing the total score to equal 100, (3) Assign an arbitrary weight (such as 1-to-5). Then assign a score (perhaps 1-to-\n10). Complete each row horizontally, indicating your estimate of the customer’s perception of each competitor’s ability to satisfy that issue. \nCompare the products of the weight times the score. The absolute value of the numbers assigned is not important. Only the comparative value \nmatters as you formulate your proposal strategy.\n7\t\nIDENTIFY YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION AND HOW YOU WILL PRESENT IT  \nIN YOUR PROPOSAL.\nBest value is cited as an evaluation factor in many U.S. federal \nand commercial bid requirements. Rather than being forced \nto adhere to specific and potentially incomplete quantitative \ncriteria, best value preserves room for judgment by the \nevaluator.\nA value proposition is a disciplined way of \nexpressing and substantiating best value, \nused by many organizations in the business-\nto-business sector, and conceptually \napplicable to the government sector. Sales presentations and \nproposals have always stressed linking the features of your \nsolution to what benefits the customer. Fundamentally, a \nvalue proposition is the summation of the net benefits of your \nsolution.\nHaving determined your solution, \nprepare value propositions for each \ntype of buyer: the economic buyer, \nthe users, and the technical buyers. \nGood value propositions are detailed, specific, and quantified.\nValue propositions establish the value basis for the business \nrelationship. They describe how your solution will improve \nthe customer’s business and how that improvement will be \nmeasured. Tailor value proposition(s) to each type of buying \ninfluence.\nValue propositions generally include the following elements:\n•\t Quantified business improvement\n•\t Timing\n•\t Solution\n•\t Investment cost\n•\t Payback\n•\t Results measurement and tracking (ROI)\nThe overarching value proposition is typically stated in \nthe executive summary. If you state a quantified value \nproposition in the executive summary, consider organizing \nthe executive summary around components of your value \nproposition. Essentially, the quantified component values \nsum to the total value.\nPlace supporting value propositions targeting the economic \nbuyer, technical buyer, users, and contract managers in the \nrelevant volume summary or major section summary.\nVA LU E  P R O P O S I T I O N \nN E T B E N E F I T S  O F \nS E L L E R ’S  S O LU T I O N\n=\nSee EXECUTIVE   \nSUMMARY; \nVALUE  \nPROPOSITIONS,\nCapture Guide.\nTotal added value is the \nsummation of the benefits \nminus the purchase cost \nand implementation cost \nof the seller’s solution.\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n229\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nDRAFT SPECIFIC STRATEGY STATEMENTS THAT DEFINE BOTH WHAT YOU WILL \nDO AND HOW YOU WILL IMPLEMENT THEM.\nSome proposal managers develop proposal strategy \nstatements, as they develop an outline.\nProposal strategy can be implemented in five  \nfundamental ways:\n1.\t Emphasize your strengths.\n2.\t Mitigate your weaknesses.\n3.\t Highlight your competitors’ weaknesses.\n4.\t Downplay your competitors’ strengths.\n5.\t Focus on discriminators.\nEffective strategy statements incorporate both strategic \nand tactical aspects. The strategic portion establishes your \nposition. The tactical portion defines how you will implement \nthe strategy, using the action steps. Think of the strategic part \nas what you will do and the tactical part as how you will do it.\nStrategy statements are not statements used in the  \nproposal. They apply at the capture, proposal, and  \nproposal section level. \nCapture strategy example \nWhat:\nWe will emphasize our perceived ability to complete the design-build \nof a distribution center on time\nBy:\n•\t Taking the customer on a plant tour of the XYZ distribution center \nin Orlando, FL\n•\t Citing three other distribution centers completed on schedule \nduring the past 5 years\n•\t Providing contact names, phone numbers, and quotes verifying \nour on-time completion of three similar projects\nProposal strategy statement example \nWhat:\nWe will emphasize our perceived ability to complete the design-build \nof a distribution center on time\nBy:\n•\t Including in our proposal photos of the XYZ distribution center in \nOrlando, FL\n•\t Citing three other distribution centers in a table in our proposal, \nall listing the center, place, owner, promised completion date, \nand actual completion date\n•\t Listing in our proposal the contact names, phone numbers, and \nquotes verifying our on-time completion of three similar projects\nSection strategy statements are \nessentially the same as proposal \nstrategy statements in form, content, \nand implementation. \nA well-written proposal strategy statement enables the  \nwriter to visualize how the strategy will appear on the page. \nFor example:\n•\t Describe or Discuss implies text.\n•\t Show implies a graphic.\n•\t Include implies a sketch, drawing, photo, table, flow \nchart, or graph.\n•\t Cite or Quote implies text set off or emphasized by \ndifferent formatting or white space.\nIf you cannot visualize the page, refine the strategy  \nstatement. Compelling proposal content is derived from  \ngood strategy statements.\nIn terms of implementation, the way you emphasize your \nstrength may be identical to how you highlight a competitor’s \nweakness. Similarly, how you mitigate your weakness may \nbe identical to how you neutralize a competitor’s strength, as \ndemonstrated in the following examples:\nProposal strategy example\nYour competitor has a reasonable reputation for completing projects \nwithin budget. Your organization had a recent cost overrun on the \nsimilar ABC project. The strategy statement to mitigate your weak-\nness and downplay the competitor’s strength might be the same.\nProposal strategy statement example\nWe will mitigate our perceived weakness in completing similar  \nprojects within budget by:\n•\t Citing the lessons learned from the recent ABC project.\n•\t Including a table listing all materials and sub-contract tasks that \nhave been pre-negotiated prior to submittal.\nWe will downplay our competitor’s perceived strength in completing \nsimilar projects within budget by:\n•\t Citing the lessons learned from the \nrecent ABC project.\n•\t Including a table listing all  \nmaterials and sub-contract tasks \nthat have been pre-negotiated  \nprior to submittal.\nSee STORYBOARDS AND\nMOCKUPS: CONTENT \nPLANNING TOOLS\nSection strategy \nstatements appear in \nstoryboards or annotated \noutlines. Some proposal \nmanagers develop them \nfrom proposal strategy \nstatements, or section \nwriters develop them as \nthey develop storyboards.\n\nProposal Strategy\nShipley Proposal Guide\n230\n©Shipley Associates\n9\t\nUSE TRADE-OFFS TO VALIDATE YOUR APPROACH AND GHOST THE COMPETITION.\n Trade-offs show you have considered alternatives and have \nselected the best solution for the customer. Instead of just \nselecting the first item available or your usual approach, you \nconsidered the customer’s needs, risks, and budget, and offered \nthe solution that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks.\nGhosting is simply offering a trade-off when one of the \nalternatives you rejected is being offered by the competition. \nYou ghost the competition when you raise the specter of \ncompetitors’ weakness, without naming them.\nThe primary way to downplay competitors’ strengths and \nhighlight their weaknesses is through ghosting. Never mention \ncompetitors by name. Instead, highlight any areas of weakness \nthey have.\nOne of the strategic advantages of ghosting is that you do not \nhave to fully justify your position. You only create doubt, as \nshown in the following example: \nWe considered using the recently developed new adhesives to  \nassemble the hybrid drone at a reduced cost, but rejected them as \nbeing potentially higher risk in long-term use versus the long-proven \nrivet approach.\nFigure 5 offers some additional ghosting approaches. Use \nghosting judiciously. Overuse can turn off the customer.\nCOMPETITOR’S WEAKNESS\nYOU STRESS\nSafety problems\nCite your strong safety record. Offer industry averages for comparison.\nLabor unrest\nEmphasize the importance of a reliable workforce. Note that avoiding the cost of a strike justifies higher hourly wages.\nHigh design cost\nEmphasize low overheads and specific industry focus.\nPoor reliability\nStress redundant design costs less than lost revenues from poor availability.\nExtended downtime\nEmphasize your local service center and built-in diagnostics.\nCost overruns\nCite the extra care taken in estimating, material selection, and purchasing.\nFigure 5. Use Ghosting to Validate Your Approach. Plan your ghosts carefully at the capture or proposal manager level. Determine what \nghosts will be introduced and where they will be inserted in your proposal. Trade-off analyses are appropriate in every proposal section where \nrealistic alternatives are available.\n\nQuestion/Response Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n231\n©Shipley Associates\nQUESTION/RESPONSE PROPOSALS\nBid requests largely composed of questions are common \nin telecommunications, professional services, health care \nmanagement, IT, and many international sectors.\nMany question/response bid requests are created by \nconsultants hired by customers’ organizations because they \nlack the internal expertise or time to \nprepare the bid requests themselves. \nConsultants compete for this \nbusiness by selling a more thorough \napproach, often resulting in more \nquestions, longer responses, and more   \nevaluation time.\nImprove your probability of winning  by concentrating on two \nactivities:\n1.\t Place additional emphasis on your executive summary, \nthe only part of your proposal the customer is likely to \nread, start to finish. \n2.\t Develop a response strategy to enable you to focus on \nyour strengths and discriminators.\nThe second activity requires taking a modified storyboard-like \napproach. Allocate your time, plan your response, review your \nplanned response, then draft your response.\nMany responses to these types of requests can be produced \nwith content previously developed. Always tailor this content \nand check for accuracy and currency.\nQuestion/response proposals are responses to bid requests that consist of a series of questions. Bidders are asked to answer \nthe questions in order and usually in a set template or spreadsheet.\nQUESTION/RESPONSE PROPOSALS\nReview all questions and determine \nformat restrictions.\nAllocate more time to investigate answers to critical \nor highly technical questions.\nUse boilerplate when available.\n1\n2\n3\nQuickly outline each response and review with \nmanagement before submitting.\n4\nIdentify where graphics can be used to \ncut text (if allowed).\nAnswer the question, trying to be responsive, \nnot just compliant.\nInsert section summaries to provide perspective \nand to gain a competitive advantage.\n5\n6\n7\nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\nMODEL DOCUMENT 13 \nis an excerpt from a \nquestion/response \nproposal.\n\nQuestions/Response Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n232\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nREVIEW ALL QUESTIONS AND DETERMINE FORMAT RESTRICTIONS.\nReview all the questions and understand limitations or \nrestrictions to your responses. Look for questions with the \nfollowing characteristics:\n•\t Involve the customer’s major issues or hot buttons.\n•\t Offer an opportunity to discriminate your offer—making it \nunique and of higher value.\n•\t Create a gap between the requirement and your \nimmediately available solution.\nDepending on the size of the proposal and the time available, \nthe proposal manager, the writer, or both can review the \nquestions. \nBe sure you understand the exact response format the \ncustomer expects. Answering questions in Microsoft Excel \nor through an online portal limits formatting and response \nlength.\n2\t\nALLOCATE MORE TIME TO INVESTIGATE ANSWERS TO CRITICAL OR HIGHLY \nTECHNICAL QUESTIONS.\nAssign questions to team members based on workload \nand areas of expertise. Sort through the requirements and \nquestions to identify those that will be most challenging. \nHighly technical questions often require research and input \nfrom subject matter experts. Allow adequate time for this \nresearch and input, even when drawing from a content library.\n3\t\nUSE BOILERPLATE WHEN AVAILABLE.\nReuse or boilerplate content libraries often provide a basis \nfor answers to questions. Offer short, concise answers to the \nsimpler, less-critical questions. If a more extensive answer is \nneeded, draft a short introduction; then \nsupport your answer with boilerplate. \nTailor the reuse material and content to align with the sales \nand proposal strategy.\nTreat question/response proposals with the same rigor as you \nwould a more open-ended customer request. Apply the same \nprinciples of win strategy and customer focus as you provide \nanswers to questions.\n4\t\nQUICKLY OUTLINE EACH RESPONSE AND REVIEW WITH MANAGEMENT  \nBEFORE SUBMITTING.\nContributors should plan their answers to the critical \nquestions first, brainstorm their response to the most difficult \nones, then review their answers with the core team. If more \nresearch is needed to answer a question, decide who will do it \nand move on to the next question.\nYour goal is to be 100 percent compliant. You should also try to \ndifferentiate your solutions and provide answers that explain \ncustomer benefits, not just features.\nSee ORGANIZATION.\n\nQuestion/Response Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n233\n©Shipley Associates\n5\t\nIDENTIFY WHERE GRAPHICS CAN BE USED TO CUT TEXT (IF ALLOWED).\nThink graphics first, if allowed.\nMost question/response proposals are very straightforward. \nGiven the same answer to the same question, the question \nanswered with a graphic and minimal text will likely outscore a \ncompetitor’s response answered with text alone.\nIf you insert a graphic with an action caption, you will have \nmuch less text to write. See figure 1 for an example. If the \ngraphic lacks a caption, add one. If it has a caption, tailor it \nto the proposal and to customer hot buttons. When graphics \nare not allowed, use other emphasis techniques like bullets, \nunderlining, italics, or bolding. Use emphasis techniques to \nyour advantage.\n6\t\nANSWER THE QUESTION, TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE, NOT JUST COMPLIANT.\nAnswer every question in the first sentence of your answer. \nUse the remaining text or graphics to support your answer \nand add value. \nProposal writers can err by failing to answer a question or by \nover-answering instead of answering a question with a clear \nresponse.\nOverly elaborate answers can create more questions and \nconfusion. Lawyers coach witnesses to limit their answers. \nFollow the same keep-it-simple approach.\nIn the following example, the poor response offers extensive \ninformation without directly answering the question. The last \ntwo sentences seem to conflict with the first sentences. \nThe better response directly answers the questions in the order \nasked, omits potentially confusing details, and does not mingle \nthe discussion of maintenance costs and upgrade costs.\nPoor response\nIs software maintenance available? If yes, is the price included in the \nprice of the software?\nOperating system (OS) and database management software (DMS) \nmaintenance is regularly applied at no additional cost. Also FLOORS \nsoftware, database access software, utilities, and all other system \nsoftware utilized by the Master Control system will require no mainte-\nnance fees. Any maintenance or upgrade can be done by your techni-\ncians or ours. Our maintenance is supplied on a time-and-materials \nbasis at $600/day for ABC Company.\nBetter response\nIs software maintenance available? \nYes. ABC Company will have regular software updates by the Master \nControl System at no cost.\nIf yes, is the price included in the price of the software?\nYes. Software maintenance is included in the price of the software. You \nwould incur NO additional costs for software maintenance.\nINCREASE\nPRODUCTION\nEXPENSES\nMONTHS\nFigure 1. Use Graphics to Improve Evaluation Scores. Graphics are an effective way to communicate data quickly and simply. Using graphics \nlike the one shown here to answer question/response bid requests can significantly decrease the amount of text in a proposal section. Evalua-\ntors can quickly interpret the graphic and move on to finding the response to the next question. \n\nQuestions/Response Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n234\n©Shipley Associates\n7\t\nINSERT SECTION SUMMARIES TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE AND TO  \nGAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.\nWith question/response proposals, evaluators may read your \nanswers but still be unclear about your approach.\nWhen possible, insert a short section summary before \nanswering individual questions on \na common topic. Enhance it with a \nsummary graphic when appropriate. \nEvaluators will appreciate the added \nperspective and often give higher scores \nas long as the summary is concise. The \nhelpful tone of your approach suggests that your organization \nis easy to work with.\nFew organizations submitting question/response proposals \nbother to include summaries other than the executive \nsummary, so a series of concise major topic summaries gives \nyou a competitive advantage. Make each summary more \npersuasive by stressing the overall benefits to the customer at \nthe beginning. \nEnd the summary by noting that each question from the \ncustomer’s bid request is answered in the order listed in the \nbid request.\nGood example of a proposal section summary.\n4.0  Software Maintenance\nISI offers ABC Company comprehensive, trouble-free software \nmaintenance at no additional cost for 10 years following software \ninstallation.\nAll of ABC’s needs for convenient, low-cost, system availability are \nmet by our software maintenance plan.

Like any other \nemphasis device, overuse reduces the effectiveness.\nThe qualified expert that you propose is redundant because \nany expert is by definition more than just qualified. Your new, \ninnovative approach is redundant because it must be new to \nbe innovative. \nRedundant words and deliberate repetition are different. To \nmake a proposal more persuasive, memorable, and clear, good \nwriters deliberately repeat key words throughout the proposal. \nDeliberately repeat memorable sales messages in the \nexecutive summary, section summaries, theme statements, \nsection headings, and action captions. Repeated items are \nmore likely to be remembered.\nGood writers avoid confusion by using the same word for the \nsame concept. Inexperienced proposal writers mistakenly \nchange words referring to the same item or concept because \nthey think it makes their writing more interesting or impactful. \nThrow out your thesaurus. Use words consistently through the \nsales cycle.\nRedundant words or phrases unnecessarily qualify other words or phrases. Eliminate unnecessary words.\nREDUNDANT WORDS\nEliminate redundant words unless used \noccasionally for emphasis.\n1\n1\t\nELIMINATE REDUNDANT WORDS UNLESS USED OCCASIONALLY FOR EMPHASIS.\nEliminate unnecessary words. Most redundant words are \nunnecessary. If the meaning is the same after removing a \nword, do it. \nDo not say that you offer desirable \nbenefits, since all benefits are \ndesirable by definition. While \nemploying a licensed electrician \nmight be absolutely essential, \nnothing is more important than \nessential. Absolutely essential does suggest urgency by \nexaggerating, but too much exaggeration prompts customers \nto discount your ideas.\nUse redundant words in proposals in two circumstances:\n1.\t To emphasize a point.\nPlanning is absolutely essential to meet every milestone.\n2.\t To mirror the bid request.\nEvery bidder must include a chapter on past performance.\nUse redundant words to \nmatch the wording in bid \nrequests. For  \nexample, when asked \nfor a Past Performance \nsection, call it Past  \nPerformance.\n\nRedundant Words\nShipley Proposal Guide\n236\n©Shipley Associates\nCall the chapter Past Performance, even if the words are \nredundant.\nThe impact of using redundant words for emphasis diminishes \nrapidly.

Some bid requests exclude similar \nwork performed by specific proposed individuals when they \nwere not part of your organization.\nWithout proof of experience and performance, proposals \nare sometimes a collection of “trust me” claims. A common \nproposal mistake is to relegate experience and performance \ndata to a separate section or attachment. Integrate relevant \nexperience and performance data into the body of the \nproposal adjacent to your claims.\nEven when separate relevant experience and performance \nsections are requested, include both within other proposal \nsections to support your claims. Different evaluators reviewing \ndifferent sections seldom link your claims in a separate section.\nRelevant experience and past performance are directly solicited sections in many bid requests and are vital content for all \nproposals. Both are frequently cited in evaluation criteria.\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE\nInclude relevant experience and past performance \ndata in your proposal in the exact location the bid \nrequest requires.\nIntegrate support examples when making \nexperience and performance claims.\nEmphasize experience and performance graphically.\n1\n2\n3\nUse a success story formula to tell a \nconsistent, complete story.\nAddress all weaknesses known or \npotentially known by the customer.\nEmphasize lessons learned personally over \nlessons learned from others.\n4\n5\n6\n1\t\nINCLUDE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE DATA IN YOUR  \nPROPOSAL IN THE EXACT LOCATION THE BID REQUEST REQUIRES.\nDirections in the request can be quite \ndetailed. Follow them explicitly.\nCustomers view past performance as \none of the best indicators of future performance. One example \nof past performance’s importance to customers is the U.S. \nacquisition regulations requirement for past performance as \none of two mandatory evaluation factors, along with price  \nor cost. \nSee COMPLIANCE AND  \nRESPONSIVENESS and \nOUTLINING.\n\nRelevant Experience and Past Performance\nShipley Proposal Guide\n238\n©Shipley Associates\nThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy requires the \nfollowing performance areas be considered:\n•\t Quality of service \n•\t Cost controls\n•\t Timeliness of performance\n•\t Business relationships\nKnowing your customer and their expectations is key to \ncompliance and success.\n2\t\nINTEGRATE SUPPORT EXAMPLES WHEN MAKING EXPERIENCE AND  \nPERFORMANCE CLAIMS.\nMuch like the guidelines for introducing and integrating \ngraphics with text, integrate your support of claims on the \nsame or a facing page. Evaluators should not have to turn the \npage or scroll very far to find support.\nSupport and scientific proof are not the same.

Use Graphics to Support Claims. Write your caption in a \ncustomer-focused style. Include the customer need, the reason you \nwere selected, and the result. Make the caption long enough to tell \nthe complete story.\nExamples cited to support the seller’s \nclaims are often referred to as “success \nstories.” Look for relevant success \nstories in your organization’s marketing \nmaterials, news releases, employee \nnewsletters, and web pages.\nSee ACTION \nCAPTIONS.\nEarly Completion Earns $200,000 Award Bonus.

Use Matrices to Relate Experience to Technical Understanding. When examples of experience must be placed in another section, \nmatrices like this one tie relevant experience directly to your technical discussion in the body of the proposal. Even if evaluators do not check \neach one, they get the strong impression that you have relevant experience.\n6\t\nEMPHASIZE LESSONS LEARNED PERSONALLY OVER LESSONS LEARNED  \nFROM OTHERS.\nMany incumbents with performance problems fail to \nunderstand and present their lessons learned as strongly as \nthey could. Reading how to juggle does not make a person a \njuggler.\nReading studies about how and why a component failed \nor a service was inadequate is inferior to having done the \nstudy. Some items or facts, often intangible, are omitted from \npublished studies.\nThe following example illustrates how an incumbent used \ndirect, personal experience to win a 5-year contract renewal:\nA company that operated a government facility under contract for \nthree consecutive, 5-year terms was competing for another 5-year \nrenewal. To avoid the appearance of favoritism, the government \nintentionally limited the size of the solicited proposals to negate the \nincumbent’s advantage. \nThe incumbent’s overall strategy was to stress the complexity \nof the tasks it performed to frighten the evaluators from \nchanging contractors. The proposal strategy was to present \nthe proposed tasks and lessons learned in a series of \ndetailed tables, charts, diagrams, and lists to emphasize the \ncomplexity of those tasks. \nThe incumbent won. A comment in the debrief was, “We did \nnot realize that the support you provided was so complex.”\nAll lessons learned from past performance need to be \ngathered for easy access and retrieval on future proposals.\n\nResumes\nShipley Proposal Guide\n242\n©Shipley Associates\nRESUMES\nResumes, like other documents, should be organized \naccording to the readers’ needs. However, resumes are \nevaluated differently when individuals are being hired versus \nwhen teams are being considered as part of a project team.\nPeople filling individual positions screen resumes to eliminate \nunsuitable applicants before reading in depth to determine \nwho to invite for interviews. Individuals’ resumes usually \nbegin with an employment objective, then present a logical \nprogression in their experience, skills, and training. \nEvaluators who screen resumes in \nproposals face a more complicated task; \nmultiple positions and tasks are involved and the subsequent \npersonal interviews, if any, are limited. \nResumes, well maintained, are another form of boilerplate or \nreuse content that needs to be managed.\nProposal resume evaluators are trying to answer four key \nquestions about each team:\n1.\t Do they understand our needs?\n2.\t Is there a firm commitment to the project?\n3.\t Is there a match between position requirements and the \nindividuals proposed?\n4.\t Does the team cover all requirements?\nResumes in proposals should address all four questions and \nalso include the following practices:\n1.\t Clearly define the requirements of each key position\n2.\t Name and commit individuals for all key positions\n3.\t Include tailored resumes to precisely match position \nrequirements and individuals’ specific experience\n4.\t Use matrices to demonstrate all requirements are \ncovered \nRESUMES\nWhen possible, name the individuals \nrecommended in your proposal.\nTailor the resumes for key positions \nin every proposal.\nIdentify who will be proposed and prepare their \nresumes before the heavy writing and production \neffort begin.\n1\n2\n3\nArrange your tailored resumes as instructed or \nbased on requirements.\n4\nAssemble a resume database that is searchable, \ncurrent, and easily tailored.\nKeep resumes brief, clear, and error free.\nUse capability and skill matrices to emphasize the \ntotal capabilities of large teams.\n6\n7\n8\nAvoid adding photos of the people proposed \nunless it supports your strategy.\n9\nResumes in a proposal are critical to selling what is often your most important discriminator—the individuals you propose.\nInclude abstracts or summary resumes of \nindividuals proposed for key positions.\n5\nSee ORGANIZATION.\n\nResumes\nShipley Proposal Guide\n243\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nWHEN POSSIBLE, NAME THE INDIVIDUALS RECOMMENDED IN YOUR PROPOSAL.\nIf you want to improve your chances of winning, overcome \nresistance to naming people in your proposal. A clear, best \npractice when selling services is to name specific individuals \nwho will do the work whenever possible.\nResistance to using specific names is usually because the \nbidding organization cannot be certain that the individuals \nrecommended in the proposal will be available when the \nproject is awarded. \nBe realistic. Do not intentionally propose a bait and switch, \nproposing one person when you plan to use a different \nperson. In the long run, you lose your credibility. If you fear \na competitor might propose its most experienced people \nwith no intention of using them, ghost them as shown in the \nfollowing examples:\nWe could follow common practice and propose using only our most \nexperienced people to provide this service. Instead, we have done our \nbest to identify and propose the most experienced people we expect \nto be available at the anticipated start date. Should any individual \nproposed not be available, we will give you the right to review and \napprove all changes.\nIf you doubt the importance of naming individuals, consider \nhow some service bid requests read:\nIndicate by name the individuals who will provide services. Indicate \nwhether they will serve a primary or secondary role. All individuals \nwith primary roles must be full time. For individuals with secondary \nroles, indicate the percentage of their time already committed to oth-\ner projects, name those projects, and indicate the percentage of time \nthat will be available for this project.\n2\t\nTAILOR THE RESUMES FOR KEY POSITIONS IN EVERY PROPOSAL.\nIf you do not have time to tailor the resume for key positions, \nyou should not be bidding. Tailor each resume to emphasize \nthe fit between the requirements of the position and the \nexperience of the individual proposed. \nClearly identify key positions. In one debrief, a losing bidder \nwas told: \nYour failure to recognize the Software Development Manager as a key \nposition indicated your lack of understanding of the requirements.\nYour identification and justification of the key positions should \nbe part of your strategy and solution.\nDo your  \nbest to be \nrealistic.\n“ \n”\n3\t\nIDENTIFY WHO WILL BE PROPOSED AND PREPARE THEIR RESUMES BEFORE THE \nHEAVY WRITING AND PRODUCTION EFFORT BEGIN.\nTeams that wait to name individuals for key positions until the \nproposal is almost finished run out of time to tailor resumes. \nForce an early decision and get the resumes tailored.\nIf necessary, tailor the resumes of several individuals for the \nsame position. Then insert the correct one at the end.\n\nResumes\nShipley Proposal Guide\n244\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nARRANGE YOUR TAILORED RESUMES AS INSTRUCTED OR BASED ON                  \nREQUIREMENTS.\nAlways prepare resumes as instructed. Resumes are usually\nordered in one of the following ways:\n•\t Reverse chronology\n•\t Functional requirement\n•\t Accomplishment\n•\t Narrative\nThe reverse-chronology resume lists experience and education \nfrom latest to earliest.\nThe functional-requirement resume organizes work \nexperience by job function, disregarding chronology.\nThe accomplishment resume features positive achievements \nand emphasizes results over chronology.\nThe narrative resume is written in first or second person, \ntelling a story about the person, presenting data in complete \nsentences.\nFunctional and accomplishment resumes are best for \nproposals. Evaluators try to minimize risk, hence their concern \nthat the bidder understands the requirements of the position, \nand the named individual has performed the same task well in \nthe past.\nThe easiest proposal resumes to evaluate are the ones that \ndirectly match the functional position requirements to the \naccomplishments, like the one shown in figure 1. Resumes \nlike this can be quite compact, permitting two or three to be \nplaced on a single page. Develop this type of resume in the \nfollowing manner:\n1.\t List the name of the person and the position you are \nproposing them to fill at the top.\n2.\t Develop a list of the primary functional requirements of \nthe position. List them on the left side, most important \nones first.\n3.\t Directly adjacent, list where the person has performed \nthe same duties, stating their accomplishments or \nresults achieved. \n4.\t List the years they performed the job, if appropriate, \nmaking it easy to total their years of similar experience.\n5.\t List any other relevant data about the person in the \ncolumn to the right. \nThe width of the columns can vary, depending on the amount \nof information required. This type of resume can be rapidly \nassembled from standard, searchable resumes kept in a \nresume database.\nRESPONSIBILITIES \nYEARS \t\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\n   PROFESSIONAL\nMajor responsibility \nMajor responsibility\nMajor responsibility\n3\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\n2\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\n1\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\n2\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\n3\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\n4\t\nDescribe what they accomplished.\nList degrees, additional training, licenses, \npatents, certifications, professional associ-\nations, awards, etc. List the most important \nones first, as space permits.\nFigure 1.

Position requirements are either established in the bid request or by the proposing organization as it develops its \nmanagement approach.\n6\t\nASSEMBLE A RESUME DATABASE THAT IS SEARCHABLE, CURRENT, AND  \nEASILY TAILORED.\nDevelop a standard, searchable resume database. Numerous \ndatabase software products are available. \nConsider the proposal preparation software products that \nmeet your needs. Some offer excellent ways to retrieve and \nmatch position requirements to personnel capabilities using \nsophisticated search algorithms. \nAssign a person to regularly update resumes, not just to \nbuild the initial set. Many organizations routinely insert long \nresumes that are more than 5 years old and contain obviously \nirrelevant information. This can disqualify you from the bid.\nPlace an expiration date on each resume, just like your \nboilerplate and reuse material. Automatically flag expired \nresumes for updates at set intervals. If no update is received \nwithin 6 months, then remove the resume from your database.\n\nResumes\nShipley Proposal Guide\n246\n©Shipley Associates\nJ E S S I C A  \nS M I T H\nP R O J E C T  M A N A G E R \nM a s t e r  o f  C o m p u t e r \nM a s t e r  o f  C o m p u t e r \nS c i e n c e\nS c i e n c e\nU n i v e r s i t y  o f \nI o w a ,  2 0 X X\nE X P E R I E N C E\nP R O J E C T  \nM A N A G E R\nManaged major application development project for Information Systems \nunder a contract awarded by General Motors.

Keeping them error free and current is \ncritical when evaluators are looking for reasons to eliminate \nbidders. Mistakes imply poor quality and are valid grounds  \nfor elimination.\nDo not expect to hear poor quality of resumes cited as a reason \nfor elimination in debriefs, but it is often cited in private.\nSome bid requests include forms that must be completed \nfor named positions. However, the forms are often poorly \ndesigned, difficult to read, and waste space.\nWhen faced with a form, recreate the form in the exact order \ngiven, as shown in figure 3. Group the information and \nsummarize it to make the resume easier to read. While some \nmight consider this risky, evaluators have given positive \nfeedback to this effort. Always seek the customer’s approval  \nif possible.\nPlace a note similar to the following at the beginning of the \nresume section:\nAll resumes and their content are arranged in the order specified in \nyour bid request. To make them easier to read, we have reentered \nthem to facilitate your evaluation and to maintain a consistent \nappearance.\nFigure 3. Design Resumes That Are Easy to Scan. Given the bid request requirements, evaluators can easily see if the person meets their \nrequirements without having to read the resume. Many evaluators check a few, then accept the rest as accurate.\nR E S U M E\n\nResumes\nShipley Proposal Guide\n247\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nUSE CAPABILITY AND SKILL MATRICES TO EMPHASIZE THE TOTAL CAPABILITIES \nOF LARGE TEAMS.\nReviewing resumes can be a daunting task for an evaluator. \nSimplify this review by offering capability and skill matrices \nlike the one shown in figure 4. \nThe chart works on two levels. For the senior evaluator, the \ngraphic gives the impression that the requirements for people \nwith a wide range of skills are both covered and backed up. \nFor the detailed resume evaluator, the matrix offers a way to \nsummarize capabilities, yet perhaps not read all the resumes. \nThe detailed evaluator will likely check a few for accuracy, then \naccept the matrix as accurate. Make sure that it is accurate.\nFigure 4. Use Capability and Skill Matrices to Emphasize Your Total \nTeam’s Capability. List the positions and people on one axis and \nsome combination of their skills and experience on the other axis. \nThe example uses shapes to differentiate the types of experience and \nthe role of each individual.

Outdated photos get the same \nreaction from evaluators as you have when looking at old \nschool yearbooks.\n•\t Do all the photos look alike? Dissimilar appearance, \nbackgrounds, dress, or lighting detract from your claims \nof having an integrated team.\n•\t Are you positive that all evaluators are free of prejudice? \nAppearance has no bearing on a person’s ability to \nperform. What if someone objects to a person’s gender, \nage, race, hair color, hair length, facial hair, height, or \nweight?\n•\t Do you have the time to take photos? Are the people \navailable? Do you have the systems to incorporate and \nprint quality photos?\nUse photos if they support your strategy. For example, if the \ncustomer organization knows and likes the people proposed, \nthe photo reinforces that relationship. If you have been \nbuilding the relationship between the people proposed and \nthe customer during the capture process, use photos. \nThe most effective use of photos in a proposal is to emphasize \nteaming experience with group photos and to emphasize \napplications experience with site photos.\nSee PHOTOGRAPHS.\n\nRisk Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n248\n©Shipley Associates\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nSome sellers prefer to avoid any discussion of risk. They \ncorrectly see risk as negative but incorrectly avoid discussing \nrisk because it is a negative topic. \nCustomers know every offer entails \nrisk; the best practice is to explicitly \ndiscuss how the risk in your offer \nwill be managed. Government \nbuyers of complicated systems \nare well aware of risk and require risk management plans in \nproposals. As a result, risk management practices, including \nformal discussions of risk in proposals, are more advanced in \ngovernment market sectors than the nongovernment sectors.\nRisk is normally associated with cost and schedule, but risk \npermeates every aspect of a program, including program \nmanagement, technical performance, quality, service support, \nand security. Proposal teams often struggle to demonstrate \nthat their solution offers the least risk. However, most \ncustomers recognize that superior value justifies increased \nrisk. The key is to understand what degree of risk is acceptable \nto each customer.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRecognize all aspects of risk.\nDevelop a risk management strategy.\nConsider placing a risk management paragraph in \nyour executive summary.\n1\n2\n3\nAnalyze and discuss risk and risk management \nsimilarly in each proposal section.\nReduce risk premiums by explicitly costing \nanticipated risk management actions.\n4\n5\nRisk management is the seller’s strategy for managing or containing the risks inherent in a proposed approach or offer. The \nunderlying assumptions are that every offer entails risk and that risk can be contained or reduced with appropriate management.\nCompany risks are internal \nconcerns or gaps and are \nnot relevant unless they \naffect proposal or perfor-\nmance risk.\n\nRisk Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n249\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nRECOGNIZE ALL ASPECTS OF RISK. \nEvaluators normally focus on risk in two evaluation criteria \nitems: proposal risk and performance risk. \nProposal risk is the risk associated with a seller’s proposed \napproach to meeting the bid request requirements. Proposal \nrisk includes both your technical and management approach. \nPerformance risk involves evaluating the seller’s ability to \nperform based on relevant present and past performance. \nEvaluators consider the data included in your proposal and \ndata gathered independently. Evaluators assess several \nfactors:\n1.\t Is the experience you cite relevant?\n2.\t What was the result?\n3.\t What did you learn that reduces risk on this contract?\nRisk is not limited to the prime contractor. Performance \nevaluations include all proposed members of your team, \nincluding partners, other corporate divisions, subcontractors, \nand vendors.\nIn the U.S., the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) \nhas increasingly emphasized performance risk. Other \nsophisticated buyers are doing the same. \nBuyers realize that minor savings in the purchase price \nare often lost when they select a higher risk contractor. To \nbetter identify positive or negative patterns in contractors’ \nperformance records, OFPP has taken several initiatives to \nstandardize the evaluation of performance risk:\n1.\t Evaluate corporate performance rather than just \nexperience. (What if the result of the experience was poor?)\n2.\t Check references of past customers.\n3.\t Develop standard questionnaires to improve both \nquality and comparability.\n4.\t Encourage contractors to complete customer satisfaction \nsurveys every 6 months.\nSeeing what sophisticated buyers are evaluating begins to \nsuggest what should be in your proposal.\n2\t\nDEVELOP A RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.\nAssume customers will learn about your past performance, \neither on their own or through your competitors. Most \ncustomers develop a good information network within their \nindustry. \nDeveloping a risk management strategy is a key part of \nyour overall strategy development. Use the same strategic \napproach:\n1.\t Emphasize your strengths.\n2.\t Mitigate your weaknesses.\n3.\t Neutralize your competitors’ strengths.\n4.\t Highlight your competitors’ weaknesses.\nDo all this without mentioning your competitors by name. \nWhere you have demonstrated strong performance, tell \nthe customer why you are the low-risk choice. Include \ntestimonials, quotations from performance reviews, award \nfee ratings, published data, and data that you have collected \nto support your claims. What others say about you is more \ncredible than what you say about yourself.\nWhere your performance was weak, emphasize what you \nlearned and what changes you have made. If you try to hide \nyour weaknesses, customers assume nothing has changed.\nNeutralize competitors’ strengths by \ndiscussing the lessons learned from \nstudying industry best practices or by \nhiring people with similar performance \nexperience. \nHighlight competitors’ weaknesses by citing trade-off \nanalyses of different approaches. Or cite your early failures or \nknown industry failures, then contrast them with your recent \nsuccessful performance.\nRisks are both \nmanaged and \nmitigated, but rarely \neliminated.\nSee PROPOSAL \nSTRATEGY.\n\nRisk Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n250\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nCONSIDER PLACING A RISK MANAGEMENT PARAGRAPH IN YOUR  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY.\nRisk is often a discriminator and can be an \neffective way to ghost competitors. Decision \nmakers and senior influencers are more \nlikely to worry about risk, what could go wrong, than about \nrelatively minor price or technical differences. \nIdentify the top two or three areas of greatest risk, then briefly \ndiscuss your risk management approach in the executive \nsummary. If competitors do not discuss risk, evaluators may \nassume they do not understand the problem. Your discussion \nmust be credible and real, or it could backfire. \nDiscuss risk management in one or two short paragraphs as \nshown in the following example:\nSoftware development projects have been notoriously difficult to \nestimate correctly and to deliver on schedule. Acme Software has \ndeveloped sophisticated and detailed metrics from all of our software \ndevelopment projects since 1989, enabling us to significantly reduce \nperformance risk. Our specific management approach is discussed in \ndetail in the section 3.2 Software Project Management.\nAnother best practice is to support your risk management with \na chart similar to the example in figure 1. \nSee EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY.\nRISK  AREA\nRISK  \nASSESSMENT\nIMPACT WITH \n OUR PROPOSED  \nMANAGEMENT \nAPPROACH\nSUMMARY OF OUR APPROACH\nDISCUSSED \nIN PROPOSAL \nSECTION\nKey personnel not  \navailable\nMedium\nLow\nAll positions filled & backups identified\n4.5\nLimited construction area \non site\nHigh\nLow\nUse modular design, construct modules off site, then \nassemble on site\n2.3\nFigure 2-3. Major Risks Mitigated. The two biggest risks to on-time completion have been addressed in our risk management plan. \nFigure 1. Place a Risk Management Matrix in the Executive Summary. Consider supporting a short risk management discussion with a ma-\ntrix that summarizes the major risks and assesses the risk both with and without your mitigation approach. If space permits, add columns like \nthe two on the right that summarize your approach and indicate where your approach is discussed in the proposal. \n4\t\nANALYZE AND DISCUSS RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT SIMILARLY IN  \nEACH PROPOSAL SECTION.\nTop-level discussions of risk must be \nsupported where relevant in each \nproposal section. Evaluators look for \nan established, proven risk management process to identify, \nassess, track, and manage/mitigate risk.\nIncrease the credibility of risk discussions and cut writing time \nby following a consistent process to both analyze risk and draft \nyour response.\nRisk Analysis Procedure\n1.\t Identify all risk areas. \n2.\t Assess the risks (low, moderate, or high) on a  \ndefined scale.\n3.\t Prioritize each risk according to its potential impact on \nthe solution, schedule, or cost.\n4.\t Determine and analyze the causes, not the symptoms, of \nthe risks.\n5.\t Develop alternative, backup, or parallel procedures to \ntrack, manage, reduce, or eliminate the risks.\n6.\t Assess the modified risk with your proposed risk \nmanagement approach, considering how the changes \ncould impact other aspects of your solution.\nDraft your risk management story in a similar style in each \nmajor proposal section.\nSee ORGANIZATION and \nTHEME STATEMENTS.\n\nRisk Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n251\n©Shipley Associates\nWriting Procedure\n1.\t Introduce each risk management section with a  \ntheme statement, a section summary, and a preview  \nor introduction. \n2.\t Consider including a more detailed form of the risk \nmanagement matrix illustrated in figure 1.\n3.\t Identify and define all relevant risks. Be complete and \nhonest but not alarmist.\n4.\t Follow each defined risk with an explanation of how it \nwill be managed. Cite clear decision points tied to your \nproposed alternative, backup, or parallel approach. \nDemonstrate your ability to manage this risk by citing \nexperience, independent research, or trade studies. \n5\t\nREDUCE RISK PREMIUMS BY EXPLICITLY COSTING ANTICIPATED RISK  \nMANAGEMENT ACTIONS.\nSenior managers often add risk premiums as a percentage \nof total cost or price. However, such premiums are based on \nhistorical perspectives that may have little to do with risks \nassociated with a specific offer.\nMost people contributing to cost estimates have compelling \nincentives to add risk premiums but few reasons to reduce \nthem. Layer upon layer, premiums accumulate during \nestimating and reviewing processes with little or no \ndocumentation or acknowledgement:\n•\t Estimators add “cushions” for unknown factors.\n•\t Supervisors inflate estimates to cover mistakes  \nand rework.\n•\t Department heads elevate the base because they are \nrewarded for delivering under estimates and penalized for \nexceeding them.\nBy the time a total cost estimate reaches senior management \nfor approval, the risk premium already incorporated is poorly \nunderstood and usually already too high. But with their \nfiduciary responsibilities to owners, senior managers find it \nall too easy to tack on a little more. Sales professionals are the \nonly group with a sales-commission incentive that strongly \nmotivates them to minimize risk premiums, minimize the bid \nprice, and maximize win probability.\nCounter the tendency to overprice risk. Extend the risk \nmanagement approach outlined in guideline 3 by explicitly \ncosting planned risk mitigation/recovery activities:\n1.\t Develop a risk register, a tabular listing of potential risks.\n2.\t Estimate the probability of occurrence for every risk.\n3.\t Describe your risk mitigation/recovery tasks for each \nlisted risk.\n4.\t Cost each risk mitigation/recovery task.\n5.\t Multiply each cost by the applicable probability and  \nsum the total.\n6.\t Disclose your analysis and risk premium in  \nyour proposal.\nMost bidders who explicitly cost risk find their management-\napproved premiums significantly lower than when based on \na percentage of bid cost or price. Thorough documentation of \npremiums in a proposal will also bolster credibility with the \ncustomer and simplify contract negotiations.\n\nScheduling\nShipley Proposal Guide\n252\n©Shipley Associates\nSCHEDULING\nCommon scheduling principles apply \nequally to proposals. Preparing a realistic \nschedule requires a clear understanding of \neach task and the capability of the individuals assigned. The \ntask of developing a schedule clarifies your understanding of \nthe proposal preparation project.\nThe complexity of the schedule depends on the size of \nthe proposal and the number, expertise, and location of \ncontributors. \nOne of the most common mistakes in proposal management \nis poor scheduling. Tasks originally regarded as optional \nbecome mandatory. The time lost to nonproposal preparation \nactivities at the beginning and end leaves surprisingly little \ntime for writing.\nSome proposals include complex media, like video. This \nrequires significant early collaboration to develop a schedule \nthat includes video development and production.\nSomething goes wrong on every proposal. Expect and prepare \nto cope with changes. The following broad guidelines will \nimprove your overall scheduling:\nScheduling your proposal is essential to visualize the task ahead and monitor progress. Even a one-person, single-day proposal \nbenefits from having a schedule. \nSee COLOR TEAM \nREVIEWS.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nConsider the total time available, then deduct 10 percent for a reserve to \nhandle unanticipated tasks and problems. Schedule proposal activities in the \nremaining 90 percent of the available time. \nBuild a list of events that have to be scheduled. A generic list of potential \nproposal preparation tasks is given in figure 1. Schedule the major events first, \nthen add the finer details or granularity later.\nComplete the major milestone schedule prior to the kickoff meeting.\nAfter the kickoff meeting, build a more detailed schedule, planning events \nto the day and hour (see guideline 6).\nEffective Scheduling\n\nScheduling\nShipley Proposal Guide\n253\n©Shipley Associates\nSCHEDULING\nDevelop a proposal schedule backward from \nthe due date.\nSchedule a proposal as you would any other \nproject, using the same scheduling tools.\nMinimize sequential tasks. Maximize \nparallel tasks.\n1\n2\n3\nAvoid scheduling weekends and holidays.\nKnow and plan proposal production time.\n7\n8\nRealistically estimate the time required for \nspecific tasks based on your own standards.\nSchedule time to prepare essentials of the Proposal \nManagement Plan (requirements checklist, outline, \nstrategy, response matrix, and style sheet).\nMaintain a continuous focus on \nmeeting every schedule date.\n4\n11\n12\nSchedule time for all planned reviews, allowing time \nto implement valid recommendations.\nLock down the project scope early to enable \ncontributions to work efficiently in parallel.\n9\n10\nAssign a person to each task with \nstart and end dates. \nDivide major tasks into smaller, discrete tasks.\n5\n6\n1\t\nDEVELOP A PROPOSAL SCHEDULE BACKWARD FROM THE DUE DATE.\nBegin at the due date because late proposals are usually \neliminated.\nSchedule time to deliver the proposal. Electronic delivery may \nbe faster but can increase production time.\nThen consider print time and electronic check time. Outside \nprinting often takes longer than in-house because printers try \nto keep their facilities producing at capacity. Your job deadline \nmay be affected by the printing vendor’s entire workload. \nSchedule time for a page-turn after printing to check each \ncopy. Verify that every file in your submission opens and \ndisplays correctly.\nIf video or other media is required, be sure to schedule \nadequate time for production.\nConsider time for the final senior management buy-off, \nperhaps a final Gold Team. Then schedule time to prepare for \nthe Gold Team.\nWhen you begin to lose perspective, examine the proposal \nevents or tasks from the beginning. How much time was lost \ngetting the bid request to the proposal manager? In a 28-day \nschedule, time lost at the beginning waiting for the bid request \nand at the end for reviewing and production leaves perhaps 14 \ndays to actually develop the proposal. \nFigure 1 features a generic list of proposal tasks to plan for. Add \nor delete tasks depending on the scope of your proposal.\nSee SECTION 4.3 in the Business \nDevelopment Lifecycle Guide for \nan example of a scalable proposal \nschedule.\n\nScheduling\nShipley Proposal Guide\n254\n©Shipley Associates\n\t\nACTIVITY\nSTART DATE\nEND DATE\nSet budget and scope \n_______ \n_______\nReceive approval to start \n_______ \n_______\nDetermine review cycles \n_______ \n_______\nDevelop baseline solution \n_______ \n_______\nDraft Proposal Management Plan (PMP) \n_______ \n_______\nMock up executive summary \n_______ \n_______\nTrain proposal contributors \n_______ \n_______\nBid request release \n_______ \n_______\nReceive bid request in-house \n_______ \n_______\nAnalyze bid request \n_______ \n_______\nPrepare compliance matrix \n_______ \n_______\nUpdate strategy & PMP \n_______ \n_______\nReview solution, strategy, and PMP \n_______ \n_______\nPrepare & conduct kickoff meeting \n_______ \n_______\nFreeze design \n_______ \n_______\nInitiate detailed costing \n_______ \n_______\nDevelop storyboards \n_______ \n_______\nPink Team review (of storyboards) \n_______ \n_______\nCreate first draft \n_______ \n_______\nFinal graphics cutoff \n_______ \n_______\nReceive & review costs \n_______ \n_______\nPrepare & conduct Red Team \n_______ \n_______\nRevise draft \n_______ \n_______\nFinalize costs \n_______ \n_______\nFinal review of draft \n_______ \n_______\nFinal executive summary to production \n_______ \n_______\nFinal text revisions & editing \n_______ \n_______\nDesktop publishing \n_______ \n_______\nGold Team \n_______ \n_______\nFinal production & assembly \n_______ \n_______\nPage turn\n_______ \n_______\nPackaging \n_______ \n_______\nDelivery time \n_______ \n_______\nDue date \n_______ \n_______\nFigure 1.

MAXIMIZE PARALLEL TASKS.\nClear task descriptions, quality standards, and start-and-end \ndates enable contributors to work in parallel without conflicts. \nFast-track construction managers plan parallel tasks to radically \nshorten total construction time. Do the same on your proposal.\nIf you hear contributors saying that they are waiting on \nsomeone else to finish his or her task before they start, \nyou have sequential tasks and are probably in trouble. \nLook to readjust assignments and tasks to keep your team \nproductively engaged.\n4\t\nREALISTICALLY ESTIMATE THE TIME REQUIRED FOR SPECIFIC TASKS BASED  \nON YOUR OWN STANDARDS.\nToo few organizations have developed time standards or \nmetrics for specific proposal tasks. They simply do what they \ncan in the time available.\nHowever, many organizations have been estimating document \nproduction time for years. Begin by adopting similar standards \nfor similar proposal development tasks until you develop your \nown standards.\nMeaningful productivity standards must be accompanied by \ncomplexity and quality standards. Standards are most useful \nto show trends in your organization and much less useful to \ncompare different organizations. \nFor example, bidders on complex, custom systems will \nhave more design costs incorporated in their proposal \nwriting standards than bidders of relatively similar products \nand services. A one-page-per-day standard for proposal \npreparation in one organization may be more difficult to attain \nthan an eight-page-per-day standard in another. \nExtensive use of proposal boilerplate and search and retrieval \nsoftware can radically increase the pages per day a writer can \nproduce, but what is the effect on the quality and win rate? \nWithout a clearly implemented strategy and \na well-organized document, you are still \ngoing to lose.\nFigure 2 offers some metrics to \nestimate writing time per page \ndepending on the availability, \nrelevance, and quality of \nboilerplate available.\nFigure 2. Estimate Time Standards by Task. Use these time \nstandards as a start until you develop more appropriate standards \nfor your organization. Requiring less time in your organization is not \nnecessarily excellent performance nor is taking more time a sign of \npoor performance.\nMeaningful \nproductivity \nstandards must \nbe accompanied \nby complexity and \nquality standards.\n“ \n”\nSee PRODUCTION.\nCiting reliable, meaningful pro-\nposal preparation productivity \nstandards across market sectors \nand organizations is mostly \nmeaningless.

Instead, only use resources when \nyou need them, then release them from the team. Get them \non the team; then get them off. While your scheduling is more \ndetailed and complex, you will have fewer individuals to \nmanage at any single time and will cut preparation costs.\nAssign one person primary responsibility for each scheduled \ntask, even if multiple people contribute. In some cases, that \nperson might not be the primary writer or content expert.\nConsider the time to complete each task, determine the time \navailable per day, then set the start and end dates. Pay for the \ntask, not show-up time.\n6\t\nDIVIDE MAJOR TASKS INTO SMALLER, DISCRETE TASKS.\nAssigning major tasks with relatively long completion times \nincreases your risk. If the contributor stalls early, you find out \ntoo late to respond. \nContrast the following two approaches to \nsection writing assignments. Assume that \nthe assignment is made on the first Monday, \nand the completed section is due on the second Friday.\nApproach 1 (General and poor)\nTake the bid request, identify and answer all of the implementation \nand management questions, and complete a responsive manage-\nment section in 2 weeks. (Actual elapsed time is 10 days, excluding the \nweekend, or 12 days, including the weekend.)\nApproach 2 (Specific and recommended)\nYou have 10 days to complete a reviewed and approved management \nsection. Weekends are not scheduled. Each task is due at the date and \ntime indicated on the following table.\nSchedule due times in addition to due dates to smooth work \nflow, as shown in figure 3. Setting due times conveys a more \ndisciplined tone for proposal development tasks.\nSee DAILY  \nPROPOSAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\n7\t\nAVOID SCHEDULING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS.\nYou may have to work on weekends and holidays, but do not \nplan to. Contributors are demoralized by such a schedule and \nmay lose commitment to a winning effort. Many feel abused. \nContributors feel that if management considers winning \ncompetitive new business important, they should assign \nadditional resources.\nWhen you do ask contributors to work weekends, \nmanagement must be visible, both as a morale booster and to \nencourage continued commitment to quality work. \nWhen contributors routinely work more than 10 hours per day \nand 6 days per week, productivity tends to drop to little better \nthan what could be done in a 40-hour work week.\nDAY\nTIME\nTASK\n1\n2 pm\nReview bid request response requirements and complete section outline.

Schedule Due Times for Tasks. Smooth work flow by setting both due dates and due times for proposal development tasks.\n\nScheduling\nShipley Proposal Guide\n257\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nKNOW AND PLAN PROPOSAL PRODUCTION TIME.\nProduction people tend to be the most routinely abused \nindividuals on a proposal team. They inherit the consequences \nof all the scheduling and management mistakes. After they work \nextended days and weekends to complete a proposal on time, \nmanagement tends to view that performance as standard.\nConsider adding 50 percent to your production estimate to \ncope with potential time delays. Use any extra time to polish \nthe proposal. Do a thorough page-turn to identify and correct \nsmall errors and improve overall production quality. Figure 4 \nshows an efficient flow of proposal production.\nIf video is part of the deliverable, schedule extra time for \nediting and production.\nSee PRODUCTION.\nFigure 4. Plan Proposal Production. First, a production manager must be appointed. The production manager prepares a production plan \nand publicizes its flow at the kickoff meeting. The manager seeks to purchase required supplies early. When a production plan is in place, the \nprocess continues smoothly, allowing every proposal deliverable to be accounted for and timing to be reasonable.\n9\t\nSCHEDULE TIME FOR ALL PLANNED REVIEWS, ALLOWING TIME TO IMPLEMENT \nVALID RECOMMENDATIONS.\nDelaying scheduled reviews results in the following common \nproblems:\n•\t Individuals completing their sections on time are delayed.\n•\t Reviewers have conflicts, forcing a change of reviewer \nwho has less time to prepare.\n•\t Reviewers are rushed, reducing the quality of the review.\n•\t You lose time to respond to reviewers’ recommendations.\nOne reviewer can do a quality review on approximately 40 \npages per day. If the proposal uses extensive boilerplate \nand has had previous reviews by the assigned and other \nevaluators, you can increase this to 80 pages per day but \nreview quality will drop.\nSee COLOR TEAM  \nREVIEWS.\nAppoint \nProduction \nManager\nPublicize \nProduction \nFlow at \nKickoff\nPrepare \nProduction \nMockup\nDetermine \nReview \nRequirements\nPurchase \nSupplies \nEarly\n\nScheduling\nShipley Proposal Guide\n258\n©Shipley Associates\n10\t LOCK DOWN THE PROJECT SCOPE EARLY TO ENABLE CONTRIBUTORS TO WORK \nEFFICIENTLY IN PARALLEL.\nThe project schedule should be distributed at the kickoff \nmeeting. Avoid schedule changes except those prompted by \nexternal events, such as changes in the bid request. \nMajor changes in the schedule indicate poor management. \nFrequent minor changes, where 99 percent of them delay the \ntasks, suggest a lack of discipline or that proposal managers \nare not honest with their teams. Contributors begin to  \nexpect delays and are less disciplined about completing  \ntasks on time.\n11\t SCHEDULE TIME TO PREPARE ESSENTIALS OF THE PROPOSAL  \nMANAGEMENT PLAN (REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST, OUTLINE, STRATEGY,  \nRESPONSE MATRIX, AND STYLE SHEET).\nPressure from management or impending deadlines prompts \nproposal managers to schedule kickoff meetings before the \nessential elements of the PMP are complete. Contributors \nthen commence work that is loosely defined, \nrequiring more extensive revisions or even \nstarting over. \nAvoid rework by doing things right the first time. Clearly define \neach task assignment, including clear quality standards. \nContributors seldom meet a proposal manager’s expectations \nwhen they do not understand their tasks.\nWhile planning seems to delay initial work, planning actually \nsaves more time than it takes.\nSee PROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT \nPLAN.\n12\t MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON MEETING EVERY SCHEDULE DATE.\nHold a daily stand-up meeting to keep contributors focused on \nmeeting every schedule date. Remind them what must  \nbe accomplished and the impact of  \nslipped dates.\nPlanning smaller tasks also helps maintain \nschedule focus. Improve schedule focus by using one of the \nfollowing approaches:\n•\t Send short, concise, daily emails or text messages to each \ncontributor, especially if the team is dispersed.\n•\t Post an enlarged schedule on the proposal room wall. \nContributors see it daily. Refer to the schedule in every \nmorning stand-up.\nSome proposal managers schedule two stand-up meetings each \nworking day. They quickly review progress and expectations for \nthe day in a morning meeting. They use a mid- to late-afternoon \nmeeting to review progress and unresolved issues.\nSee DAILY  \nPROPOSAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\n\nService Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n259\n©Shipley Associates\nSERVICE PROPOSALS\nProducts are tangible and services are intangible. However, \nthinking products are easier to sell than services reflects an \nincomplete view of the sales process.\nSuccessful sellers of both products and services help their \ncustomers build a vivid vision of how customers’ processes will \nimprove after selecting their solution.\nWhile customers may feel more comfortable paying for a \nphysical product than an intangible service, the product only \npromises to deliver something that is intangible, just like the \nservice. \nCustomers have the difficult task of selecting services without \nknowing the quality of the services to be delivered, so they rely \non indicators:\n•\t Experience with the seller or vendor\n•\t Promptness, clarity, and courtesy of responses to \ninquiries\n•\t Relationship with the sales or capture team\n•\t Quality of presentations and demonstrations\n•\t Relevant experience and performance of the proposing \norganization\n•\t Customer testimonials\n•\t Quality of the proposal submitted\n•\t Price\nYour focus on these indicators will help demonstrate your \nunderstanding of the services needed.\nService proposals and product proposals are more alike than many proposal managers and writers think, especially when used \nin complex sales. In complex sales, winners are selected based on the benefits that buyers believe will be delivered. Few buyers \nselect systems, services, or products based on appearance.\nSERVICE PROPOSALS\nCreate a vision for the customer of what life will be \nlike after after implementing your solution.\nShowcase your solution with \ngraphics and good writing.\nDiscriminate, focusing on people.\n1\n2\n3\nPresent service methods graphically.\nExploit and compete with incumbency, as \nrelevant.\nCut costs, not margins.\n5\n6\n7\nDiscriminate services with clear \nunderstanding of results.\n4\n\nService Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n260\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nCREATE A VISION FOR THE CUSTOMER OF WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE  \nAFTER AFTER IMPLEMENTING YOUR SOLUTION.\nEvery sale of a service or product impacts the buyer’s \nprocesses and solves a problem:\n•\t Reduces operating or capital cost\n•\t Improves quality\n•\t Improves service level\n•\t Reduces cycle time\n•\t Improves profitability\nThe vision you create for your customer must cover three areas:\n1.\t What and how services and products will be delivered\n2.\t How people and processes in the customer’s \norganization will be impacted\n3.\t How individuals and the customer’s organization will \nbenefit, both tangibly and intangibly\n2\t\nSHOWCASE YOUR SOLUTION WITH GRAPHICS AND GOOD WRITING.\nBoth graphics and text are essential for visualizing and \nshowcasing your solution and making it memorable.\nConsider how images are used in \nadvertising to indicate customer \nsatisfaction. Advertisers present images of happy people using \nthe product or experiencing or recalling the service to convey \nfeelings of satisfaction. \nNovelists use words to evoke such vivid personal images \nof events, places, and emotions that many people are \ndisappointed when they see the movie. Or recall how people \nviewing images of an event often remark, “You had to be \nthere.”\nTo improve your proposals, consider the following methods \nto convey a service or product vision in each of the three areas \nlisted under guideline 1:\n1.\t What and how services and products will be delivered\n\t– Use graphics such as sequential sketches, photos, or \nicons with short subcaptions. \n\t– Use text to present lists of sequential tasks or actions \nthat will be taken.\n2.\t How people and processes in the customer’s \norganization will be impacted\n\t– Use graphics such as sequential sketches or photos to \nshow what their employees will do or see. \n\t– Use screen prints of the images operators will see on \ntheir operations console. \n\t– Use photos of other customers using the same products \nor experiencing the same or similar services.\n\t– Use text to describe the impact of a product or service, \nas in the following emotional proposal excerpt for a \ncancer detection device:\nImagine, doctors operating on a patient can point a RxT laser \nat live tissue, analyze the reflected light through a spectro-\nscope and PC, and immediately determine if the tissue is malig-\nnant or benign. Further imagine that this can be real within 16 \nmonths if you fund this program.\nThe following example was used to sell a design \ncontract:\nA proposal for a traffic management system for a major north-\nern European city used 2-1/2 pages to describe how the system \nwould cope with a typical winter morning commute. The \nscenario described minute-by-minute how traffic was rerouted \nto cope with snowfall, accidents, and temporary tie-ups.\n3.\t How individuals and the customer’s organization will \nbenefit, both tangibly and intangibly\n\t– Use graphics such as individuals appearing relaxed, \nhappy, satisfied, and more energetic, whether using the \nproduct or experiencing the service.\n\t– Combine before-and-after images. An architectural firm \ntook photos of a proposed site, then superimposed \nimages of the proposed or a similar facility. \n\t– Use familiar icons such as images of stacks of coins, \nbills, or gold bars to represent monetary benefits or \nsmaller trash bins or fewer trash bins to represent \nreduced waste.\n\t– Use text to help evaluators visualize the impact of not \nhaving an item or service, like the cancer detection \ndevice discussed earlier in item 2:\nImagine the consequences when a surgeon removes too little \ntissue. Further imagine the impact when a surgeon removes \ntoo much tissue. \nContrast real-time cancer detection with the alternative biopsy \nmethod. Doctors send patients through recovery while waiting \nfor test results. Patients and their loved ones are subjected \nto a painful, higher-risk, and anxiety-filled recovery, perhaps \nfollowed by further surgery.\nSee GRAPHICS and \nPHOTOGRAPHS.\n\nService Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n261\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nDISCRIMINATE, FOCUSING ON PEOPLE.\nPeople are potentially the most powerful discriminator when \nselling services. To be a discriminator, two conditions must \nbe met:\n1.\t The feature cited must be unique; clearly, no two \npeople’s abilities are identical. \n2.\t The customer must care about the uniqueness of the \nperson or people, a condition often created during the \nsales process.\nUse the following methods to discriminate your people:\n•\t Name the people you propose to fill key positions. \nCorrectly identifying which positions are key also \ndemonstrates your understanding of the tasks required. \n•\t Consider naming the people proposed for additional \npositions.\n•\t Indicate the percentage of their time to be devoted to this \nproject and the percentage of time already committed to \nother projects.\n•\t Introduce the key people to the customer organization’s \ninfluencers and decision maker during the capture \nprocess, prior to submitting your proposal.\n•\t Consider ghosting typical bait-and-switch tactics to \nemphasize your honest, realistic approach.\n•\t Tailor all resumes. Place abbreviated resumes in the body \nof your proposal. \n•\t Include individual photos of the people proposed only \nif you have previously introduced them to the customer \norganization. \n•\t Include photos of groups or teams containing individuals \nproposed if they show previous teaming experience or \nspecific performance experience.\n•\t Use matrices to summarize the directly relevant skills and \nexperience of individuals on your team.\nSee DISCRIMINATORS \nand RESUMES.\n4\t\nDISCRIMINATE SERVICES WITH CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF RESULTS.\nTake a hint from some of the most experienced and \nsophisticated purchasers of complex services. U.S. \ngovernment agencies often require an Integrated Master Plan \n(IMP) and an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). Prepare and \ninclude task descriptions with clearly defined and measurable \ncompletion criteria, directly tied to your project schedule. \nGeneralized, boilerplate descriptions of tasks and generic \nschedules will win only if your competition is equally \nincompetent or lazy.\n5\t\nPRESENT SERVICE METHODS GRAPHICALLY.\nWhen described in text, most service processes appear \nhopelessly complex. When presented graphically, they appear \nclear and straightforward, increasing an evaluator’s confidence \nin the seller. \nConsider some of the following ideas for service graphics:\n•\t Include a series of small, icon-like sketches to illustrate \neach service step.\n•\t Present an excerpt of a service procedure from your \nservice manual.\n•\t Insert a sequenced, numbered checklist.\n•\t Insert actual screen shots or graphics from your online \nservice manual.\n•\t Show a flow chart.\n•\t Use a collage of photos or sketches to illustrate the variety \nof services available.\n•\t Emphasize quality results by inserting a service report, \nservice rating, or positive quotes from customers.\n•\t Insert summary resumes that emphasize relevant \nexperience.\n•\t Insert photos showing the proposed people performing \nidentical or similar tasks.\nSee GRAPHICS for examples. \nSee also RELEVANT  \nEXPERIENCE/PAST PERFOR-\nMANCE and RESUMES.\n\nService Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n262\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nEXPLOIT AND COMPETE WITH INCUMBENCY, AS RELEVANT.\nIncumbents win approximately 80 percent of all re-competes. \nSurveys of why incumbents lose cite poor service as the \noverwhelming reason. \nExploit incumbency by correcting service problems before the \nbid. If you are too late, stress the specific corrections planned \nand the complexity of the required service. Fear of change is a \npowerful incentive to retain the incumbent. \nWhen attacking incumbents, stress the specific steps you will \ntake to improve service. While incumbents can be replaced \non price, many winners regret the losses resulting from a low-\nball win.\n7\t\nCUT COSTS, NOT MARGINS.\nThe cost differences among the top bidders in service \ncompetitions are often a fraction of a percent. Develop a more \ncompetitive price by focusing on cutting \ncosts out of your bid rather than simply \nreducing margins.\nBidders that uniformly pare \ntime and materials estimates \nby a uniform amount over the \nentire bid are effectively reducing \nmargins. \nMake your bid more competitive \nby looking for ways to improve \ndelivery efficiency. To improve your cost competitiveness, \nconsider the following methods:\n•\t Increase the span of control of managers, effectively \nreducing head-count in your most costly labor categories.\n•\t Reduce the levels of management.\n•\t Adjust the placement of individuals in required labor \ncategories. When customers mandate labor categories \nand rates, they typically cite midpoints in each category. \nYou may not have to propose at the midpoint.\n•\t Establish a new cost center for each major bid to prevent \nincluding overhead allocations irrelevant to that bid.\n•\t Identify and incorporate physical assets within your \norganization that have been fully depreciated. This \nreduces corporate overhead allocations based on asset \nvalues.\n•\t Subcontract tasks that can be delivered more \neconomically by others. \n•\t Recalculate existing cost standards. Existing standards \nmay not be based on the same assumptions. \n•\t Review task descriptions to prevent tasks from being \nover-specified. Identify which tasks could be performed \nby a lower cost labor category. \n•\t Review delivery processes for potential productivity \nimprovements through skill improvement, tooling \nimprovement, or additional technology.\n•\t Reduce reporting cost by proposing at the minimal level \nrequired in the bid request.\n•\t Search for opportunities to cut overhead and increase \nbusiness through automated order entry, billing, and \npayment.\n•\t Actively manage the account post sale to identify \nadditional sales that you can deliver cost effectively with \nthe existing or an augmented team.\nSee COSTING and \nTEAMING, Capture \nGuide.\nCustomer satisfaction is \nsubjective. Customers must \nbe continuously sold and \nresold before, during, and \nafter the service is sold. \nSeamlessly, flawlessly \ndelivered services are often \nforgotten.\nService deliverers must \nrepeatedly reinforce the \nvalue of their services \nor risk being replaced \nor eliminated. The more \ncustomized and tailored \nthe service, the harder the \nincumbent is to replace.\n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n263\n©Shipley Associates\nSTORYBOARDS AND MOCKUPS: CONTENT PLANNING TOOLS\nContent planning is an efficient \nway to integrate customer needs, \nissues, and hot buttons into the \nsales strategy. A content plan \nprovides information from the bid \ndocumentation and instructions \nto guide the contributors in their \nresponse development.  \nA content plan template is a good \nway to jump-start writing and \ngenerally includes the following sections:\n•\t Assignment information\n•\t Customer needs, issues, and hot buttons related to  \nthe section\n•\t Strategy statements related to the section\n•\t Win themes\n•\t Section outline\n•\t Suggested visuals \nStoryboards and mockups are content \nplanning tools that are closely related but \ndistinctly different. Both are used to help writers plan, develop, \nand review key concepts before drafting text. \nStoryboards have a one-to-one relationship \nwith major topics of the proposal, while \nmockup pages relate directly to proposal \npages. For example, a single storyboard may \napply to a 10-page proposal section. The mockup for the same \nsection would contain a full 10 pages. \nStoryboards use words and graphics to outline a concept. When \nsomeone builds a house, the storyboard equivalent is a plan \nbook that shows a sketch of the home accompanied by a short \ndescription, as shown in figure 1.\nExtending the house analogy, the mockup is equivalent to the \nfloor plan, showing the allocation of space and the relationship \nof key elements to scale, also shown in figure 1.\nOne problem among proposal managers and writers is \ninconsistent definitions. The following definitions clarify \ndifferent techniques used to create a content plan:\nOutlines are a sequential list of topics to be discussed.\nAnnotated outlines are outlines with annotations or \ncomments about the contents of the topics. For proposals, \nannotated outlines may include references to the source of \nrequirements, the author assigned, section length or page \nallocation, approximate number of visuals desired, and various \ndates materials are due. When annotated to this degree, the \nannotated outline becomes the proposal responsibility matrix. \nStoryboards are conceptual planning tools used to help \nwriters plan each section before drafting text. They contain \nassignments, bid request requirements, strategies, preliminary \nvisuals, and content. \nStoryboards are frequently misunderstood, misused, and \nhave poor reputations with many proposal writers. Shipley \nAssociates’ storyboard form, the Proposal Development \nWorksheet (PDW) is a tool that can simplify the process.\nMockups are page-for-page representations of the actual \npages in the finished proposal. They contain the same \nelements as the draft, namely, headings, themes, visuals, \naction captions, and text. Mockups transition writers from the \nstoryboard to drafting. \nMockups permit writers to draft any section in any order while \nmaintaining the planned organization. This helps writers \nappropriately allocate the space devoted to each point.\nStoryboards and mockups aid managers as well as writers. \nProposal managers use them to review and improve the  \nwriter’s plan before wasting time and money on text that cannot \nbe used. \nContent planning is an essential proposal planning activity. These plans reflect the sales strategy and help writers and other \ncontributors develop compelling content. Storyboards and mockups, are planning tools used to develop and review new \ncontent before writing text. Effective content planning should save time and improve response quality.\nThe Proposal Development \nWorksheet (PDW) is a content \nplan developed to lessen the \ninitial reluctance of many writers \nto use storyboards. Writers often \ncompleted their PDWs before they \nknew they had used a storyboard. \nMost importantly, writers learned \nhow much easier and faster they \ncould draft quality proposal \nsections when using storyboards.\nSee OUTLINING.\nA sample content \nplan is included \nin MODEL  \nDOCUMENTS.\n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n264\n©Shipley Associates\nSTORYBOARDS AND MOCKUPS: CONTENT PLANNING TOOLS\nUse storyboards to develop and review  \nnew material.\nFocus on the content planning \nprocess more than the tool itself.\nUse the core proposal team to prepare the \nassignment; use the contributors to develop \nthe content.\n2\n3\n4\nUse mockups to allocate space and \nsimplify the writing task.\nStoryboard sequentially; \nmock up interactively.\nTrain writers to plan content using \nstoryboards and mockup templates.\n6\n7\n8\nConsider the storyboard a key \nmanagement tool.\n5\nManage the difficult transition from \nstoryboarding to the first draft.\n9\nFigure 1.

The template should be easy to tailor and \nadapt based on the complexity and length of the proposal. \nWin strategies, customer hot buttons, key message themes, \nand potential graphics should all be part of the content plan \ntemplate to facilitate content development. \nAn example of a content plan template is shown in Model \nDocument 8.\n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n265\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nUSE STORYBOARDS TO DEVELOP AND REVIEW NEW MATERIAL.\nSee QUESTION/ \nRESPONSE  \nPROPOSALS.\n3\t\nFOCUS ON THE CONTENT PLANNING PROCESS MORE THAN THE TOOL ITSELF.\nThe overall process of making clear assignments, then \nplanning, reviewing, and approving each contributor’s \napproach before drafting is more important than what \ninformation is selected to be on the template. \nAdapting the templates to fit the effort warranted and the time \navailable is more important than the form’s detailed design. \nMost proposal storyboards are developed for large, complex, \ncompetitive systems proposals. These detailed storyboards \nare often not needed for small, quick turnaround responses. \nFor example, the topics contained in a detailed Proposal \nDevelopment Worksheet (PDW) are listed in figure 2 beside a \nshortened version that might be used for a rapid, commercial \nresponse.\nThe Sales Proposal Planner is a storyboard-like tool used \nto plan an entire small proposal.

The second column lists the contents for a shortened version. The third lists contents \nof the Sales Proposal Planner used to plan rapid-response commercial proposals where the services and products being sold are similar for \ndifferent competitions. \nMany proposal efforts do not warrant using storyboards \nand mockups for every section. Storyboards and mockups \nare most valuable when developing new material. They are \nless valuable and often should not be used when proposing \nessentially the same products and services to similar \ncustomers. When you have previously written material \n(boilerplate) available, focus on tailoring your sales message, \nadjusting the details and length.\nStoryboards should save more time than they take. For similar \ninformally solicited proposals, use a single storyboard to plan \nthe entire proposal. Then mock up the executive summary, \nwhich should be written for every proposal. \nFor Question/Response bid requests, use a modified storyboard \napproach to outline and review your responses before drafting. \nIdentify the more important or more difficult \nquestions; then plan and review your response \nbefore drafting text.\nSee MODEL  \nDOCUMENT 9.\n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n266\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nUSE THE CORE PROPOSAL TEAM TO PREPARE THE ASSIGNMENT; USE THE  \nCONTRIBUTORS TO DEVELOP THE CONTENT.\nOn larger efforts, the proposal core team should develop \nclear, concise assignments for each contributor prior to the \nproposal kickoff. At the kickoff meeting, contributors are \ngiven their assignments.\nContributors need to develop the content in the content plan \ntemplate to prepare them to write. If their thinking is unclear, \ntheir writing will be unclear.\nSome proposal professionals advocate using a small, select, \ntrained group to prepare the content plan completely, then \ngive them to the writers to save time. This approach  \nusually backfires. Contributors tend to ignore content  \nplans completed by others, and they draft text with  \nlittle forethought. \nMost contributors can write well if they can develop a \nclear concept prior to writing. The process of content \nplanning leads to a clearer concept, reducing the rework  \nfor everyone involved and improving document quality  \nand win probability.\n5\t\nCONSIDER THE STORYBOARD A KEY MANAGEMENT TOOL.\nWith content planning tools, \nmanagers can see what \ncontributors are thinking \nbefore they write, thus reducing \nexpensive rewriting. To ensure \nthat writers treat content \nplanning seriously, managers \nmust review all content plans \nthoroughly and frequently. \nDo not wait to review storyboards or mockups until they are \ncomplete. Be agile in your approach \nto review sections incrementally to \nget writers on track faster.\nOne way to speed content planning is to facilitate the work in a \nworkshop-like manner. Follow these steps:\n1.\t Explain each task, establishing clear quality standards.\n2.\t Ask each writer to complete that task in a relatively short \ntime. \n3.\t Circulate, answering any questions.\n4.\t Review individual sections as a group, encouraging \ncollaborative, constructive information sharing and \nsuggestions for improvement. Repeat as warranted.\n5.\t Advance to the next section.\nIf content plans are posted and maintained electronically on \na secure website, establish common procedures to control \nversions, reviews, approvals, and revisions.\nPost all suggestions for improvement on the content plans \nwith the reviewer’s name and contact information.\nRemove unnamed comments. Remove comments that are \nvague and require further discussion. Anonymous comments \nare often negative and hurt the team environment. If a \ncomment is valid, sign it and assume ownership.\nComment on content plan progress in a daily stand-up \nmeeting. Praise the better examples.\nElectronic content plans offer \nadvantages when used and \nmanaged properly. Major \nadvantages are (1) material \ncan evolve into a draft and \n(2) managers can more easily \nmanage a geographically \ndispersed team.\nSee DAILY  \nPROPOSAL TEAM \nMANAGEMENT.\nResist the impulse to cut \nand paste boilerplate into \nelectronic storyboards. \n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n267\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nUSE MOCKUPS TO ALLOCATE SPACE AND SIMPLIFY THE WRITING TASK.\nMockups can be an intermediate step between the  \nstoryboard and drafting the text. The act of constructing a \nmockup forces writers to consider the relative importance \nof topics to the customer and to the offer. After mockups are \ncomplete, writers can work on any section without losing \ndirection or momentum.\nMockups should be done quickly. Neatness does not count. \nA 5-page section should be mocked up in less than 2 hours; a \n20-page section in less than one-half day. \nMany writers construct thumbnail mockups first. Using \nthumbnails, they can see the entire document at once, making \nit easier to allocate topics and content over the available \npages. Then they sketch full-scale mockups if they need \ngreater detail before drafting. The entire mockup development \nprocess is shown in figure 3 in thumbnail sketches.\nConstruct a mockup in the following steps:\n1.\t Establish the overall page layout from the proposal style \nsheet, such as single- or double-column.\n2.\t Estimate the number of pages for the entire section, \nincluding text and integrated graphics.\n3.\t Allocate the pages available to the topics to be \ndiscussed according to their importance to evaluators, \ntempered by their complexity. Then place section \nsubheadings to reserve the space allocated. In formally \nsolicited proposals, top-level topics reflect compliance \nrequirements.\n4.\t Place and label boxes to reserve space for major visual \nelements like themes, summaries and introductions,  \nand visuals. \n5.\t Go back and begin to flesh out the mockup. Insert the \nfollowing items, in the approximate order listed:\n\t– Insert the top-level theme statement from  \nthe storyboard.\n\t– Identify each graphic and identify it in the  \nreserved space.\n\t– List the key points to be made.\n\t– Draft complete three-part action captions for  \neach visual.\n\t– Draft every planned theme statement.\n\t– Draft the section summary and introduction.\n\t– Begin drafting text. Start where you feel most prepared \nor comfortable.\n\t– Do not worry about how many iterations are required \nto do a mockup. \nMockups are an \nintermediate \nstep between the \nstoryboard and \ndrafting the text.\n“ \n”\n\nStoryboards and Mockups: Content Planning Tools\nShipley Proposal Guide\n268\n©Shipley Associates\n1\nEstablish the overall layout.\n2\nObtain or estimate the number of formatted blank pages \navailable for your section. Example at right is a three-page \nusing two columns.\n3\nOverlay your section outline on the pages, drawing boxes for \nthe assigned space for each topic. Base the allocation of space \non your best judgment of how much space will be required for \neach outline topic. Identify adequate space for your section \nintroduction and summary, as shown to the right.\n4\nDraw boxes to show the location for the graphics you \ndeveloped on page 4 of the PDW in the locations within the \nspace you designated for each outline item. Describe or \nsketch the graphic in those boxes, and enter the appropriate \nfigure number, title, and action caption. Identify the location \nfor themes by drawing boxes.\n5\nIn each outline space, identify the content that will be \ndiscussed under that topic by using key words. Show the \nestimated space that will be devoted to that topic by the \njuxtaposition of the key words.\nFigure 3. Mockup Development Process. Mockups evolve from top-level concepts to specific details. After constructing the reduced-size \n“thumbnail” pages shown, most writers proceed to a first draft. Construct a full-scale mockup only if the document is particularly important or \nexpensive to produce. While shown here in print form for clarity, mockups can also be handwritten.\n7\t\nSTORYBOARD SEQUENTIALLY; MOCK UP INTERACTIVELY.\nWhile planning your content and preparing storyboards, \neach portion builds on previous portions, so they must be \nconstructed sequentially. For example, a writer must know  \na customer’s requirements and major issues (from the content \nplan) before determining benefits.\nWhen you develop mockups, use a top-down process, from \nthe general to the specific. Mockups constructed sequentially \nusually cram so much into a small space that they are \nunrealistic. After review, visuals and tables are often the size of \na postage stamp and the space for text is inadequate.\n6.5 Project Management\nProject Management frame-\nwork is aligned with OSG’s \norganizational structure. \n•\t 6.5.1 Account \nTeam Structure \n•\t 6.5.2 Project Management/\nProcesses Management\n•\t 6.5.3 Service Level/ \nPast Performance\n•\t 6.5.4.

Writers need training and coaching \nand must experience how these tools save more time than \nthey take.\nWhen writers are told they will be using content planning \ntools, they often make comments like “Why waste time filling \nout forms? I could be writing.”\nFew contributors are convinced storyboards and mockups \nwork until they have used them within the context of content \nplanning. Then they see how much easier it is to draft their \nsection. Here are some of the comments from the converted:\n“Having everyone throw rocks at my themes and captions in all of \ntheir iterations was brutal. But I learned how others were thinking \nand the improvement was huge.”\n“After we finished writing our drafts, the section practically wrote \nitself. “\n“I was asked to join a proposal team that had been working for 2 \nsolid weeks. Despite the proposal manager’s pressure to see my draft, \nI completed my storyboard, reviewed it with the volume manager, \nconstructed a thumbnail mockup, and drafted my section. My section \nwas the only one to pass the Red Team. I went home while the others \nstarted over.”\n9\t\nMANAGE THE DIFFICULT TRANSITION FROM CONTENT PLANNING TO  \nTHE FIRST DRAFT.\nMany contributors have difficulty transitioning from the \ncontent plan with storyboards or mockups to their first draft. \nThey seem to forget everything they went through, sit down \nat a blank screen, and start writing about themselves, their \nproducts and services, and their organization. \nTo ease your contributors’ transition from content planning to \ntheir first draft, consider the following techniques:\n1.\t Input each contributor’s content plan into the master \noutline.\n2.\t Personally check with each contributor  \n1 day of when they will begin drafting the text. \n3.\t Demonstrate how to move text from a content planning \ntool into a first draft in a group training session; then \ncheck with each contributor.\n4.\t Ask experienced contributors to mentor less-\nexperienced writers.\n5.\t Remind contributors to leave labeled placeholders to \nreserve space for content not yet available.\n\nStyle and Tone\nShipley Proposal Guide\n270\n©Shipley Associates\nSTYLE AND TONE\nStyle and tone are often confused. \nStyle is the cause, and tone is  \nthe effect. \nWriters’ and speakers’ style choices \nare implicit, whether intentional \nor accidental, conscious or \nunconscious. Your style choices \ninclude the type of document \nor presentation planned; \nmedium; word choice; sentence, \nparagraph, and document \nlength and organization; page \nand document design; emphatic \ndevices; use and type of graphics; \nand the environment where \nthe presentation is made or the \ndocument read.\nTone reflects your attitude toward \nthe customer, referring to the \nfeeling or impression conveyed \nby the speaker or writer. Tone is a \nproduct of style.\nDocument and presentation styles \nare often categorized as formal and \ninformal. Formal documents and \npresentations, such as technical \nreports, technical presentations, \nand contracts, are primarily written \nto inform—to objectively convey \ninformation. \nInformal documents and presentations, such as email, \npersonal letters, trip reports, and most memos, are generally \nwritten for people that the writer knows or feels comfortable \nwith. Informal documents are often informative, friendly, \nsubjective, casual, and personal.\nThe distinction between formal and informal styles is blurred \nin sales communications that are meant to persuade. While \nsales presentations need to be logical, factual, informative, \nand deliberate (formal characteristics), they also need to \nbe positive, informative, non-threatening, and supportive \n(informal characteristics). While a seller seeks to convey an \nobjective tone, customers rarely expect sellers to be objective.\nThe acceptability of text messages, tweets, and other informal \nsocial media depends upon the receiver and is rapidly \nevolving. One customer might find them insulting and too \npublic while another might see them as efficient, direct, and \nmore credible than messages via more conventional mediums.\nNever excuse or confuse bad writing with style. In the end, \ngood sales communications are clear, persuasive, informative, \nsupportive, well-organized, and concise. Poor sales \ncommunications are vague, confusing, unconvincing, chaotic, \nand wordy.\nStyle is the sum of the choices writers make; tone is the impact on the reader. Style choices heavily influence whether your proposals \nhelp you win competitive business.\nPresenters and writers make \nnumerous style choices. \nSome choices  \napply to both presentations \nand documents. Some are \nunique, but all should convey \na business-like tone. The \nchoices listed are  \nrepresentative, not  \nexhaustive.\nPresentation style choices:\n•\t Appearance\n•\t Length & timing\n•\t Organization\n•\t Room set-up\n•\t Visual aids\n•\t Voice tone & inflection\n•\t Word choice\nDocument style choices:\n•\t Graphics\n•\t Length\n•\t Medium\n•\t Organization\n•\t Page and document \ndesign\n•\t Sentence structure\n•\t Word choice\nDesirable business  \ndocument tone:\n•\t Accessible\n•\t Clear\n•\t Courteous\n•\t Customer-focused\n•\t Friendly\n•\t Helpful\n•\t Honest\n•\t Informative\n•\t Personal\n•\t Persuasive\n•\t Polite\n•\t Sincere\n\nStyle and Tone\nShipley Proposal Guide\n271\n©Shipley Associates\nSTYLE AND TONE\nMatch the tone of each document \nto your objective.\nOrganize proposals as the customer directs, then \nfollow the four-box organizational style.\nAdapt sentence length and structure to \neach sales communication.\n1\n2\n3\nAdopt a customer-focused writing style.\nChoose correct words.\n5\n6\nUse abbreviations and jargon only when you \nare sure readers understand them.\n4\nEliminate cliches, false subjects, \ngobbledygook, and redundant words.\nChoose a page and document design \nappropriate for this customer and opportunity.\n7\n8\n1\t\nMATCH THE TONE OF EACH DOCUMENT TO YOUR OBJECTIVE.\nThe tone of each document should support your objective \nand intended effect on the reader. A writer’s objective for \nmost documents is a combination of to do, to know, and to \nfeel. The emphasis on each varies. Turn to guideline 9 in the \n“Organization” section to see how the to do, to know, and to \nfeel are mapped into the four-box organizational style.\nThe relationship between style and tone puzzles many \nbusiness professionals. They scan thousands of documents \nin their professional, educational, and personal lives and are \nconfused by the differences. Figure 1 summarizes six types of \ndocuments by tone, intended effect, and example.\nMany organizations document their style choices in a style \nguide and software templates.\nMarketing or public relations departments set and maintain \norganizational style guidelines to support branding and \npositioning objectives. However, if corporate style guidelines \nconflict with bid request instructions, comply with bid request \ninstructions.\nThe most effective styles are context specific. Because your \nrelationship and position with each customer change by \ncompetition, adapt your style guidelines to the situation and \nyour sales strategy.\nIndividual writers on proposal teams have different writing \nstyles. Smooth the roughest, most obvious differences, but \navoid the temptation to make all writing exactly alike.

Tone Is Driven by the Intended Effect. Writers tend to adopt writing styles similar to the types of documents they were \ntrained to write. Hence, scientists tend to adopt a scientific style that is less effective in sales documents. \n\nStyle and Tone\nShipley Proposal Guide\n272\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nORGANIZE PROPOSALS AS THE CUSTOMER DIRECTS, THEN FOLLOW THE  \nFOUR-BOX ORGANIZATIONAL STYLE.\nOrganization is one of the most \nimportant style choices for all \ntypes of business documents, \nincluding proposals. A well-\nconceived organization \nsimplifies the writing, especially \nfor writers with limited \nconfidence in their writing skills. \nNothing can save a poorly organized sales document.\nThe over-riding principle is to organize every document \naccording to the reader’s interests. Apply this principle to \nproposals by following customer instructions, then placing the \nmost important items to the reader first. \nAdapt the four-box organizational structure to executive \nsummaries, entire proposals, individual proposal sections, \nreports, emails, phone calls, text messages, and virtually any \ntype of business document. \nFigure 2 shows, in the simplest form, the four  \norganizational boxes:\n1.\t Summary\n2.\t Introduction\n3.\t Body\n4.\t Review\nFor example, when drafting a response to a bid request \nquestion, you might eliminate the Box 4-Review if you feel the \ncustomer will quit reading as soon as they find the answer. \nConversely, when making a sales presentation, you might opt \nto summarize between each key point in the Box 3-Body to \nhelp the audience reconnect. When preparing a short email, \nyou might opt to place a short, concise message entirely in an \ninformative subject line and eliminate Boxes 1–4. (Unless you \nconsider the subject line as part of Box 1.)\nFigure 2. Four-Box Template. This template helps writers create an \norganized message for each sales document. Annotated examples \ncan be found throughout the Guide.\nFor expanded examples of the \nFour-Box Template, see  \nCOMPLIANCE AND  \nRESPONSIVENESS, EXECUTIVE \nSUMMARY, and ORGANIZATION;  \nPRESENTATIONS TO  \nCUSTOMERS, and SALES  \nCOMMUNICATION, Capture \nGuide.\n \nFOUR-BOX TEMPLATE \n \nCopyright 2017 Shipley Associates \n \n1 \n \nBox 2: Introduction \nPreview organization of the document. Organize around the points most likely to influence the reader. \nSubordinate topics in a proposal should be customer hot buttons or major issues. \nIf possible, link to a customer source. \nIntroduction \nSubordinate Topics \nSubordinate Topic 1 \nSubordinate Topic 2 \nSubordinate Topic 3 \nSubordinate Topic 4 \nSubordinate Topic 5 \nSubordinate Topic 6 \n \nBox 3: Body \nMaintain the same organizational scheme introduced in Box 2. \nProvide convincing details for the reader, including benefits, discriminators, the solution, proof points, and \nprevious experience.

State what you want the reader to do, know, or feel. \nClear Heading \nTheme Statement \nSummary \n3\t\nADAPT SENTENCE LENGTH AND STRUCTURE TO EACH SALES COMMUNICATION.\nSentence length and structure are key style choices. Keep \nthe average sentence length under 20 words. The average \nlength of sentences is more indicative of style than individual \nsentence length.\nVary sentence length to make your writing more interesting. \nReaders notice extremely short and long sentences. Occasional \nshort sentences, perhaps in a single-sentence paragraph, are \nexcellent emphasis devices. Long sentences are more difficult \nto write well and punctuate correctly, but are not incorrect \nsimply because they are long.\nIf you lack confidence in your writing, punctuating, and \nspelling skills, write short sentences using the simplest, yet \nmost accurate words possible. If you maintain a subject-verb-\nobject construction, you need only limited punctuation and \nspelling skills.\nSentence structure includes the grammatical structure,  \nsuch as active or passive voice, the sequence of ideas, and \nword patterns.\nGrammatical structure includes selecting active or passive \nvoice and parallel construction. The sequence of ideas relates \nto placing ideas or points in either a logical order, usually for \nclarity, or order of importance, for emphasis.\n\nStyle and Tone\nShipley Proposal Guide\n273\n©Shipley Associates\nSee ACTIVE/PASSIVE \nVOICE, LISTS, and \nTHEME STATEMENTS. \nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS.\nConsider two similar sentences:\nIf you place your order before June 30, we can complete construction \nby November 30. \nWe can complete construction by November 30 if you place your order \nbefore June 30.\nThe first emphasizes placing the order; the second sentence \nemphasizes completing the construction. The best choice \ndepends upon your situation. Generally, your tone will be \npositive and forceful if you state your claim and then qualify it.\nThe sequence of ideas in a sentence impacts theme \nstatements. Most theme statements will be stronger if the \nbenefit is placed before the feature.\nYou have many ways to structure a single sentence. Your \nchoices increase exponentially when you put multiple \nsentences together.\nA series of oddly structured sentences, \nperhaps broken into multiple phrases, \nslows the reader and conveys a stuffy, formal tone that might \nseem cold, unfriendly, or arrogant. A string of short, direct \nsentences is efficient and can sound clean and brisk, or jarring \nand abrupt, depending on the context.\n4\t\nUSE ABBREVIATIONS AND JARGON ONLY WHEN YOU ARE SURE  \nREADERS UNDERSTAND THEM.\nUsing words that customers do not understand projects \nan arrogant tone. Eliminate unnecessary abbreviations \nand jargon. Define acronyms, initialisms, other potentially \nunfamiliar abbreviations, and jargon the first time you use \nthem in each major section of your proposal.\nInsert a list of abbreviations with definitions in proposals \nexceeding 25 pages. Define unfamiliar jargon when you first \nuse it, but you do not need to define jargon in the list of \nabbreviations.\nSee ABBREVIATIONS, \nJARGON, and LISTS.\n5\t\nADOPT A CUSTOMER-FOCUSED WRITING STYLE.\nCustomer focus is an aspect of tone. While most sellers claim \nto have a customer focus, few make the style choices to project \na customer-focused tone.\nIncrease the customer focus of your proposals by making \nthese style choices:\n•\t Cite the customer organization’s vision.\n•\t Link the customer’s vision directly to the  \nimmediate purchase.\n•\t Cite the customer’s hot buttons.\n•\t Make customer ownership of the hot buttons explicit.\n•\t Address each hot button in the order listed.\n•\t Name the customer before the seller in paragraphs  \nand sentences.\n•\t Name the customer as many or more times than  \nthe seller.\n•\t Cite benefits before features.\n\nStyle and Tone\nShipley Proposal Guide\n274\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nCHOOSE CORRECT WORDS.\nChoosing correct words makes sales documents more \npersuasive, more effective, and easier to read. \nRecognize and eliminate common word problems: \n•\t Simplify or replace wordy phrases.\n•\t Use the correct word in context.\n•\t Revise words or phrases that could have more than  \none meaning. \nSee CHOOSING \nCORRECT WORDS.\n7\t\nELIMINATE CLICHES, FALSE SUBJECTS, GOBBLEDYGOOK,  \nAND REDUNDANT WORDS.\nCliches are worn-out phrases that are no longer effective. \nAvoid cliches. Regular use indicates lack of thought and effort. \nCliches are tempting when the writer is struggling to express \nan idea. However, cliches reduce the persuasiveness of sales \ndocuments. If the cliche is noticeable, reword the phrase. \nFalse subjects are words like it and there that refer to nothing. \nIt is and there are at the beginning of sentences are false \nsubjects. False subjects displace \nthe true subject of a sentence, \nwaste readers’ time, and \nobscure meaning.\nEliminate false subjects whenever possible to make your \nwriting clearer and more concise.\nGobbledygook is the use of abstract or pompous words \nand long, convoluted sentences. The meaning is often \nunintelligible. Gobbledygook, like cliches and false subjects, \nreduces the persuasiveness of sales documents and should be \neliminated.\nRedundant words unnecessarily qualify other words or \nphrases, unless used occasionally for emphasis. Overuse often \nprojects a pompous tone that is tiresome. Most redundant \nwords should be eliminated.\nSee CLICHES, FALSE  \nSUBJECTS, GOBBLEDYGOOK, \nJARGON, and REDUNDANT \nWORDS.\n8\t\nCHOOSE A PAGE AND DOCUMENT DESIGN APPROPRIATE FOR THIS  \nCUSTOMER AND OPPORTUNITY.\nPage and document design impact whether \nyour document is read, how it is read, whether \nit is understood, whether it is persuasive, \nand whether it is remembered. The physical design of your \ndocument and individual pages emphasizes or de-emphasizes \nyour messages, much like body language, word dynamics, and \nfacial expression in conversation.\nWell-designed sales documents project an accessible, \nengaging, and customer-focused tone. A good design \npromotes clear, persuasive communication even though \nreaders may not be conscious of the techniques used. Well-\ndesigned documents attract readers, and then help them \nlocate, comprehend, and remember key information. \nWhile individuals’ personal preferences differ, design \nguidelines are supported by scientific research. These \nguidelines, summarized in “Page and Document Design,” \nare broadly reflected in public media, such as newspapers, \nmagazines, journals, and books. Page design principles \napply equally to web communications such as email and text \nmessages. Short words, sentences, and paragraphs; font and \ncolor changes; and lists are page design elements.\nSee PAGE AND \nDOCUMENT \nDESIGN.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n275\n©Shipley Associates\nTASK ORDER PROPOSALS\nMaster contracts and task order proposals are increasingly \nused in many market sectors and countries by governmental \nand private organizations. Most contracts are for services, but \nproducts can be included. Master contracts are also called \nblanket contracts, period contracts, panel contracts, Indefinite \nDelivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, task order \nagreements, basic ordering agreements, and Government \nWide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).\nCustomers use master contracts and task order proposals for \nthree primary reasons:\n•\t Reduce contracting time. Customers give pre-qualified \nbidders 5 to 10 days to respond to a task order bid \nrequest, and then award the task within 10 to 30 days. \nOccasionally, the entire process is completed in less than \n5 days. Some task orders require immediate starts, but set \nwork limits until terms and conditions are finalized.\n•\t Increase flexibility. Customers cannot accurately predict \nthe types of services or products that could be required.\n•\t Support a purchasing organization. A purchasing or \ncontracting organization establishes a broad, flexible, \ncontract vehicle with a high purchase limit. Virtually any \nbuyer can use the master contract to quickly purchase \nservices by transferring their funds and purchasing \nauthority to the organization that issued the master \ncontract. In return, the purchasing organization collects \na surcharge on the purchase that supports their \norganization.\nWinning most task order proposals requires two steps:\n1.\t Win a master contract to pre-qualify to compete for \nspecific types of work.\n2.\t Compete for individual task orders under the terms of \nthe master contract.\nCompeting for master contracts is similar to competing for \na large services contract. Competing for each task order is \nsimilar to competing in rapid-response, narrowly focused, \nbusiness-to-business competitions.\nTask order proposals are typically awarded within a governing master contract. Gain a competitive edge by developing processes \nand systems that support quality, rapid, specific responses.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n276\n©Shipley Associates\nTASK ORDER PROPOSALS\nRegard master contracts as a license to hunt.\nMarket your organization proactively to gain a \ncompetitive advantage, influence requirements, \nand win sole source contracts.\nPrepare to respond quickly by developing and maintaining \na searchable database with experience examples, proof of \nperformance examples, and key-person resumes.\n1\n2\n3\nUse graphics to rapidly and clearly \ndescribe your processes.\nPrecisely match experience and proof of \nperformance examples with each specified task.\nIntegrate success stories within technical task, \nprocess, and management descriptions.\n6\n7\n8\nFollow bid request instructions explicitly.\n4\nFocus on the task, not on requalifying to bid.\n5\nLimit management discussions to this task.\nTailor resumes for each key position.\n9\n10\n1\t\nREGARD MASTER CONTRACTS AS A LICENSE TO HUNT.\nMaster contracts pre-qualify vendors to \ncompete for subsequent task orders. \nThe master contract value is a ceiling on \nthe total value of task orders that can be \nawarded under the contract. You can win \na billion-dollar master contract but not \nhave any work. Winning a master contract simply gives you a \nlicense to compete for subsequent task orders.\nCompete for master contracts much like other diverse services \ncontracts; win by addressing \nthe customer’s issues. \nThe primary issues for an \norganization seeking pre-\nqualified vendors for anticipated work are:\n•\t Qualifications to do the work\n•\t Capability to perform\n•\t Responsiveness, including both the ability to quickly \nrespond to task order requests and the ability to solve \nproblems\n•\t Best value\nThe primary issues for an organization seeking pre-qualified \nvendors to fund their purchasing organization are:\n•\t Ability to market their services\n•\t Ability to persuade other organizations to purchase under \nthe master contracts\n•\t Qualifications, capability, responsiveness, and value are \nalso important in this scenario because vendors lacking \nthese qualities will not be selected for task order work.\n•\t Purchasing organizations desiring to cover their costs \noften issue broad contract vehicles, qualify numerous \nbidders, and set high contract ceilings. A recent bid \nrequest stated they wanted to award contracts to 14 to 16 \nvendors. \nMaster contract \nbid requests might \nalso include task \norders, which are \naddressed in guide-\nlines 2-10.\nSee RELEVANT EXPERIENCE/\nPAST PERFORMANCE, RESUMES, \nSERVICE PROPOSALS; and \nTEAMING, Capture Guide.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n277\n©Shipley Associates\n2\t\nMARKET YOUR ORGANIZATION PROACTIVELY TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE  \nADVANTAGE, INFLUENCE REQUIREMENTS, AND WIN SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS.\nBe proactive in marketing your services under the blanket \ncontract. Identify customer needs, suggest solutions, and \ninfluence the requirements. Submit brief white papers \noutlining potential task descriptions or statements of work. \nBusy customers often convert these into task order bid \nrequests. \nWhen customers’ needs are urgent, they often request 5- to \n10-day responses. Some task order requests require a 24-\nhour response. Vendors with advance notice have a distinct \nadvantage, especially if they helped draft the task description.\nMany vendors win sole-source task orders because they were \nthe only vendor that either understood the requirements \nor responded within the deadlines. One veteran program \nmanager noted that he spent 60 percent of his time drafting \nsole source task order descriptions and justifications. Of \ncourse, they were called white papers.\n3\t\nPREPARE TO RESPOND QUICKLY BY DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A  \nSEARCHABLE DATABASE WITH EXPERIENCE EXAMPLES, PROOF OF  \nPERFORMANCE EXAMPLES, AND KEY-PERSON RESUMES.\nWhen multiple vendors are pre-qualified, the ability to quickly \nprepare a quality response might be your most significant \ndiscriminator. Organizations accustomed to 30- to 60-day \nresponse periods struggle to prepare quality task order \nproposals in short time frames.\nPrepare to respond quickly by developing and maintaining \na searchable database. Many organizations archive their \nold proposals, but these boilerplate libraries often are filled \nwith vague, seller-focused, dated, inconsistent, and incorrect \nmaterial. Figure 1 lists the types of material needed to quickly \nprepare focused, persuasive, task order proposals.\nMATERIAL\nSEARCHABLE BY:\nWork experience \nand performance\nType of work, client and agency, industry, period of performance, award value, budget versus actual cost, actual per-\nformance, number of people, key people by position, reference contact, performance assessments, customer issues, \nkey decision maker, key influencers, customer values, site photos, lessons learned\nResumes\nNames, projects, responsibilities by project, dates, performance results, client comments and references, education, \nlicenses and certifications\nProcess/product \ndescriptions\nGraphical depictions, action captions, text descriptions, site and product photos, test results, performance data\nFigure 1. Recommended Database/Boilerplate Materials. Organizations that develop and maintain searchable databases can prepare  \npersuasive, winning task order proposals more efficiently, effectively, and quickly than their competitors.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n278\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nFOLLOW BID REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS EXPLICITLY.\nFollow bid request instructions explicitly, especially when the \ntime to respond is short. Follow the prescribed format. Answer \nquestions immediately after the question, and then support \nyour answers with boilerplate as needed.\nWhile this guideline might seem \nobvious to most readers, task \norder evaluators say that failing to follow instructions is the \nmost frequent vendor mistake and a common reason bids are \ndisqualified. Evaluators often need specific information in a \nprescribed format to obtain internal approvals to award a task \norder contract. \nSee COMPLIANCE AND  \nRESPONSIVENESS,  \nOUTLINING, and QUESTION/\nRESPONSE PROPOSALS.\n5\t\nFOCUS ON THE TASK, NOT ON REQUALIFYING TO BID.\nFocus your task order proposal on the task, not on re-\nqualifying your organization. You qualified under the master \ncontract. \nFigure 2 lists and describes the primary issues of task order \nevaluators.\nISSUE\nDESCRIPTION\nPeople\nWho will fill the key positions, by name? Are they available during the time required? What is their specific, relevant ex-\nperience? (Not a chronological list of all experiences.) Do the people proposed understand this customer’s issues, needs, \nand organization?\nApproach\nCan you simply and clearly describe exactly how you will complete this particular task? (Not a description of how you \ngenerally approach similar tasks.)\nPerformance\nWhat past performance is relevant to this task order? When bidding for the master contract, you likely cited large proj-\nects that covered many aspects of the work described in the RFP. That work might have been delivered by another part \nof your organization and might not be relevant to this task. Past performance examples need to be of similar size and \nscope; offer similar people; and offer a similar, local management team.\nSchedule\nDo you know exactly when each task element will be started and completed? \nCost\nDo you know what the cost will be, based upon a nearly identical previously completed task? Are the conditions suffi-\nciently similar to trust your estimate?\nManagement\nExactly who will manage this task and how? Secondarily, where does this person report in your organization? (Not how \nis your organization managed, or what is your management philosophy.) \nRisk\nExactly what risks do you anticipate? How serious are these risks, both in impact and probability, and specifically how \nwill you manage these risks?\nFigure 2. Key Task Order Evaluator Issues. Task order evaluators are most interested in these issues. Address each one clearly and succinctly \nin your response.\n6\t\nUSE GRAPHICS TO RAPIDLY AND CLEARLY DESCRIBE YOUR PROCESSES.\nGraphics are the single, easiest way to describe your processes. \nClear graphical depictions of processes inspire confidence \nthat the bidder knows what they will do. Text descriptions \noften appear complex, suggesting to many \nevaluators that the process is complex, risky, \nand perhaps not well understood. \nWhen using graphical process descriptions, make them \nspecific to the task. Avoid generic, conceptual graphics. \nPlacing words in ovals and then drawing lines between the \novals does not mean that they are connected. \nSee ACTION \nCAPTIONS and \nGRAPHICS.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n279\n©Shipley Associates\nAvoid generic text and graphic process descriptions that \nsuggest you will figure out what to do after contract award. \nYou probably will not get the award. The major advantage of \na graphical task description is that you can quickly tailor it in \nthe action caption and labels. Text descriptions are more time \nconsuming to modify, so they are often not tailored.\n7\t\nPRECISELY MATCH EXPERIENCE AND PROOF OF PERFORMANCE EXAMPLES  \nTO EACH TASK.\nBuyers prefer vendors that have successfully completed \nidentical tasks and employed the same people under identical \nconditions, in the same industry. Prove that you satisfy those \npreferences by citing experience and performance examples \nthat match the requirements of each proposed task.\nMatch this customer’s issues with a prior customer’s issues. \nFor example, if the customer is concerned about on-time \ncompletion, describe a similar task that you completed on \ntime. If the need is to solve a complex design problem, then \ncite where you solved a difficult design problem.\nThe quality or degree of the issue/example match is more \nimportant than having numerous examples. Additionally, the \nrelevance of the individual members’ professional experience \nto the issues is more important than the organizational \nexperience of the vendor.\nSee RELEVANT EXPERIENCE/\nPAST PERFORMANCE, RESUMES, \nand SERVICE PROPOSALS.\n8\t\nINTEGRATE SUCCESS STORIES WITHIN TECHNICAL TASK, PROCESS,  \nAND MANAGEMENT DESCRIPTIONS.\nIf the bid request asks for a Past Performance section, include \nit. If the bid request limits past performance to a specific \nnumber of contracts, follow the instructions. Select a range of \nprojects that addresses each of this customer’s issues rather \nthan multiple examples addressing the same issue.\nAdd further emphasis, interest, and credibility to the \nexperience of your key personnel and organization by \nintegrating success stories in your process descriptions. \nFew evaluators will take the initiative to explicitly link the \nPast Performance section to task descriptions. Make the \nlink for them. Also link the proposed personnel to the past \nperformance citations, if possible.\nKeep success stories short, following the \nfour-step process summarized in Relevant \nExperience/Past Performance, guideline 4. \nIntegrating success stories offers two additional advantages:\n•\t Bidders can cite more experience examples than \npermitted in the Past Performance section. Past \nperformance examples are usually limited in the bid \nrequest.\n•\t Bidders can directly link cited Past-Performance-section \nexamples to specific contract tasks. Repetition increases \nmemory retention.\nSee RELEVANT \nEXPERIENCE/PAST \nPERFORMANCE.\n\nTask Order Proposals\nShipley Proposal Guide\n280\n©Shipley Associates\n9\t\nLIMIT MANAGEMENT DISCUSSIONS TO THIS TASK.\nEvaluators want to know how tasks will be managed, how the \npersonnel will be managed, and how the manager will address \ntypical risk issues such as employee behavior, turnover, \nabsences, and training. They are not interested in broad \ndescriptions of how your organization is managed. Address the \ntask manager’s level of authority and the resources controlled \nby or available to the task manager.\nIn some instances, evaluators might reduce management \ndiscussions for subsequent task order awards under the same \nmaster contract. For example, they may know that you report \nprogress on all active task orders weekly using a specific \nformat and submittal process. You might not need to sell them \non the quality of this process or explain the report structure \nand format. \nWhen bidding on successive task orders, ask customers to \nclarify what they want. When in doubt or if the customer is not \navailable, follow the bid request instructions.\n10\t TAILOR RESUMES FOR EACH KEY POSITION.\nThe single, most important discriminator in task order \nproposals in a services environment is the people that you \npropose to complete the task. No matter how short the \nresponse time, tailor the resumes for every key position. \nTypical or representative resumes for non-key \npositions are usually acceptable.\nYour ability to correctly state which positions are key is an \nimportant indicator of your understanding of the task and the \ncustomer. Many bidders fail because they do not identify key \npositions or they identify key positions incorrectly.\nName all people who will fill key positions. Generic individuals \nare never as appealing as named individuals. Evaluators often \ninterpret unnamed positions as lack of qualified resources or \npoor planning. Better to ask permission to change a person \nthan to not name anyone to fill the position. \nOrganize resumes according to the evaluators’ needs and \ninterests. Evaluators prefer functional requirement and \naccomplishment resumes. They seek to understand precisely \nhow the proposed person’s accomplishments, knowledge, and \nexperience match the requirements of the position. Create an \nexecutive summary at the beginning of the resume showing \nthe relevance of the person’s qualifications to the task order \neffort.\nSee RESUMES.\n\nTeam Selection and Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n281\n©Shipley Associates\nTEAM SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT\nProposals are usually a team effort. There are many members \nof the team with different roles and responsibilities. \nUnderstanding the common roles you will work with during \nproposal preparation and development is vital to a cohesive \neffort.\nKnowing how to maximize a team member’s abilities can \nhelp you develop an effective proposal, so learn what \nqualities your team members have and then assign roles \nbased on that information.\nTeam selection and management are a matter of roles rather than positions. Proposal efforts range from a single person to \ndedicated teams comprising hundreds. Selecting proposal team members and managing them vary widely by organization, \nmarket sector, and even culture. Most aspects of project team management apply equally to proposal teams.\nTEAM SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT\nEstablish a proposal management structure with \ndefined roles and responsibilities.\nTailor your approach to each proposal \nby adjusting role assignments.\nDocument your approach in a Proposal \nManagement Plan (PMP).\n1\n2\n3\nDifferentiate process and  \ncontent responsibilities.\nScope proposal preparation tasks based on a \nclear vision of the document to be delivered and \nrealistic time standards.\nManage the proposal like other \ncorporate strategic projects.\n5\n6\n7\nSelect the right types of people \nfor each role.\n4\nReward good performance.\n8\n1\t\nESTABLISH A PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WITH DEFINED  \nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.\nCertain roles must be filled on every proposal team. If you vary \nthe role to suit the people available, proposal quality will suffer. \nThe following roles are required on proposal teams of all sizes.\nThe capture/opportunity manager must win the order and is \nresponsible for customer contact before, during, and after the \nproposal is submitted, conforming to the customer’s rules. The \ncapture/opportunity manager owns the capture strategy. \nThe proposal manager leads the team and is responsible for \nresources, planning, scheduling, development, \nand production. The primary focus of proposal \nmanagement must be to produce a winning \nSee PROCESS.\n\nTeam Selection and Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n282\n©Shipley Associates\nproposal document. The proposal manager owns the proposal \nstrategy, derived from the capture strategy.\nThe project manager develops a winning solution that \ncomplies with the organization’s objectives. Generally, the \nproject manager (sometimes called a “solution architect”) \nis responsible to the strategic business unit manager for \nprofitability and risk management.\nThe volume manager/leader develops a specific volume \nfor the proposal manager. Volume managers are directly \nresponsible for input into their volume.\nThe proposal coordinator or \nspecialist helps the proposal manager \ncontrol the proposal development \nprocess. Typical tasks include helping \ndevelop and update plans, schedules, \nmaterials, and files; coordinating with other process \nspecialists; and helping with reviews.\nThe production lead supervises production, including word \nprocessing, graphics, and desktop publishing.\nThe editor ensures that materials, both text and graphics, \nmeet the organization’s style standards.\nThe proposal writers obtain whatever information is required \nto draft and deliver a compliant, responsive, clear, and \npersuasive proposal section to proposal management when \nscheduled. \nThe time and materials estimators prepare supportable task \ndescriptions, time and material estimates, and estimating \nrationale when required that precisely match the tasks \ndescribed by the corresponding writers.\nThe pricing staff roll time and material estimates into a final \nprice that meets customer and seller standards.\nThe focus of each of these roles changes as you progress \nthrough the seven-phase business development cycle: (0) \nMarket Assessment, (1) Long-Term Positioning, (2) Opportunity \nAssessment, (3) Capture/Opportunity Planning, (4) Proposal \nPlanning, (5) Proposal Development, (6) Post-Submittal \nActivities.\nSee APPENDIX A: TEAM \nROLES AND RESPON-\nSIBILITIES, Shipley \nBusiness Development \nLifecycle Guide.\n2\t\nTAILOR YOUR APPROACH TO EACH PROPOSAL BY ADJUSTING  \nROLE ASSIGNMENTS.\nThe roles described in guideline 1 must be assumed on \nall proposals. Ignore any of them, and the quality of your \nproposal will drop. \nOn small proposals, combine roles in a single individual. On \nlarge proposals, several people may share a single role. Worry \nmore about having the role covered than about how you \nassign the roles among the individuals available.\n3\t\nDOCUMENT YOUR APPROACH IN A PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (PMP).\nAny plan worth doing must be written. Even on a one-person \neffort, develop and document a minimum plan, then work to \nthe plan. \nDefine the structure and content required in your \norganization’s proposal management plans as part of your \nbusiness development process definition and \ndocumentation. \nIf you happen to be assigned the proposal manager’s role in \none of the many organizations that lack a defined process, \ntailor your organization’s project management process to the \nproposal project.\nSee PROPOSAL \nMANAGEMENT \nPLAN.\n\nTeam Selection and Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n283\n©Shipley Associates\n4\t\nSELECT THE RIGHT TYPES OF PEOPLE FOR EACH ROLE.\nDifferent skills are required for different roles.

When serving in a \nprocess role, remember that many contributors are primarily \nconcerned about content. People in content roles will only \nconcern themselves with process if they are convinced that the \nprocess will save them time and embarrassment while letting \nthem focus on content.\nThose in capture/opportunity management, sales, program or \nproduct management, estimating, and pricing are primarily \ninterested in content. When their content interests conflict, \nthey all see process issues as irritants that forces them to \ncompromise the content. \nEmbed process in tools, making the process transparent to the \nuser. For example, a structured tool that prompts individuals \non the task and content causes users to forget that they are \nfollowing a defined process.\nVolume managers tend to have split roles: They have been \nselected to manage a process, producing a winning volume, \nbut they usually have a content background relevant to their \nassigned volume. They often find the content issues more \ninteresting and fail to manage the process to the schedule.\n\nTeam Selection and Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n284\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nSCOPE PROPOSAL PREPARATION TASKS BASED ON A CLEAR VISION OF  \nTHE DOCUMENT TO BE DELIVERED AND REALISTIC TIME STANDARDS.\nAny person using a parametric approach to estimating knows \nthat accurate estimates rely on the assumption that the \ncontent and process are the same. Similarly, a 1,000-page \nproposal will require more writing time \nthan a 100-page proposal, assuming \nsimilar tasks and processes. Develop a clear vision of the \nproduct you will deliver, then specify the tasks required to \nproduce that product.\nIf you have a consistent process and clearly defined tasks, \nyou can accurately scope your proposal based on standards \ncollected from earlier proposals. The flaw is that too few \norganizations collect the data required to develop proposal \nmanagement standards. \nProposal professionals look to someone else to suggest the \ncorrect standard, but with inconsistent processes, products, \nmanagement, resources, and skills among organizations, \nstandards transfer poorly. \nDevelop your own proposal preparation metrics and  \nquality standards.\nSee SCHEDULING.\n7\t\nMANAGE THE PROPOSAL LIKE OTHER CORPORATE STRATEGIC PROJECTS. \nBest practice reviews show that organizations that are most \neffective at winning business view winning new business in a \ncompetitive environment to be one of their most strategic and \nimportant activities. Organizations that effectively capture \nnew business possess many of the following characteristics:\n•\t They assign their best people to proposals, not whoever  \nis available.\n•\t Management requires individuals seeking to advance \nto senior management to demonstrate an ability to \ncontribute to and manage teams that capture  \nnew business.\n•\t They define and document their business  \ndevelopment process.\n•\t They train the participants and provide the  \nresources required.\n•\t They regularly review capture and proposal projects  \nlike all other strategic projects.\n8\t\nREWARD GOOD PERFORMANCE.\nGood performers must be rewarded and encouraged at all \nphases of a proposal project. Commend good performance in \nthe daily meetings. Recognition is often more effective than \nprizes or monetary rewards.\nSell your approach and process. People who understand why \nthey are doing something are more willing and likely to exceed \nyour expectations.\nHold a victory party immediately after submittal, win or lose. If \nyou win, hold a second victory party. At minimum, notify every \ncontributor, win or lose. Too many participants never hear if \nyou have won or lost. \nMany contributors to proposals are temporarily assigned, \npulled from their regular position. Their managers tend to be \ninconvenienced by the loss and may remember it negatively \nat the next performance review. Thank good performers \nin writing, sending a written note to their managers. Some \nproposal managers ask the best performers to tell them when \ntheir salary review is due, then they personally talk to these \nperformers’ managers to support a better review.\nThe best proposal managers seem to be able to make the \neffort fun. Most proposal managers will be managing a \nfuture proposal development project and would like the best \nindividuals to be willing to help again. \n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n285\n©Shipley Associates\nTHEME STATEMENTS\nWin themes or major themes apply to the entire proposal. \nThey usually tie a single, unique discriminator to a critical \ncustomer need: \nDevelopment risk and cost are eliminated by selecting the only trans-\nport aircraft in this class that is in current production.\nTheme statements are not sales slogans, like the catchy \nphrases most commonly seen in consumer marketing:\nHave it your way™\nWhere’s the beef?™\nJust do it™\nBe all you can be™\nWe try harder™ \nSection, topic, or paragraph themes are specific statements \nthat appear in a consistent place and style within a proposal. \nSection themes are the primary focus of this section.\nBusiness capture teams sometimes confuse strategies and \ntheme statements. Strategies = things to do. \nThemes = things to say.  Effective strategies \nhave two parts:\n•\t Strategic: The position you will take\n•\t Tactical: The specific actions you will take to attain the \ndesired position\nInserting theme statements in a proposal is one tactical way to \nimplement a strategy.\nExperienced business development professionals often use \nthe terms theme and strategy interchangeably, confusing both \ntheir customers and their sales support teams. \nTheme statements in proposals link a customer benefit to the discriminating features of your offer. Themes tell readers why they \nshould select you. Powerful themes contain the most important and unique discriminators, something the customer wants that \nno one else offers.\nSee PROPOSAL \nSTRATEGY. \nTHEME STATEMENTS\nUse a logical process to brainstorm \ntheme statements.\nUse theme statements consistently.\nLink benefits to features, trying to state benefits first.\n1\n2\n3\nDifferentiate section theme \nstatements and section summaries.\nEnsure benefits go beyond advantages.\nTailor your theme structure and approach to \nthe evaluation process.\n6\n7\n8\nQuantify benefits if possible.\n4\nDraft concise theme statements, preferably \nin a single complete sentence.\n5\nUse the Theme Litmus Test to enhance the \nimpact of your theme statements.\n9\n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n286\n©Shipley Associates\n1\t\nUSE A LOGICAL PROCESS TO BRAINSTORM THEME STATEMENTS.\nFollowing a logical process enables \nyou to develop meaningful theme \nstatements more consistently and \nrapidly. Use the following theme \nstatement brainstorming checklist to help you determine the \nkey point you want the customer to remember:\n•\t What is the point of this section?\n•\t Why should the customer be impressed with what you’re \nproposing?\n•\t What aspect of your offer or approach makes it worth \nbuying?\n•\t What do you offer that is different from competitors’ \napproaches?\n•\t What makes your offer unique, desirable, or beneficial?\n•\t What does your offer do for the customer?\n•\t Why should the customer prefer your offer and \norganization over the competition?\n•\t Does your offer answer the question, So what?\nBrainstorming theme statement \ncontents sparks creative input from \nthe entire team.\nYou may prefer to develop theme \nstatements more logically. Proposal \ntheme statements should flow from the capture and proposal \nstrategy. If you have neither, follow the process outlined \nbelow:\n1.\t List the customer’s issues.\n2.\t List a feature of your solution that addresses each issue.\n3.\t Define the issue as specifically and uniquely as possible.\n4.\t Identify a similar success story. Try to quantify the \nbenefit.\n5.\t Draft a theme statement linking the feature and the \nquantified benefit to a customer issue and substantiate \nthe claim in the proposal.\nReview the following examples to see how these five steps \nwould work:\n1.\t A customer in the travel clothing and accessory business is con-\ncerned about increasing telemarketing sales revenue.\n2.\t You sell IT support services, including supplying and support-\ning Point-of-Sale software and terminals for e-commerce and \ncatalog sales.\n3.\t Individual sales clerks often do not know the customer’s \npurchase history, interests, or which related items they could \nrecommend.\n4.\t You helped a client achieve a 35 percent increase in dollars per \norder in a similar situation with a bicycle component and acces-\nsory telemarketing retailer.\n5.\t Incorporate the previous information into a theme statement: If \nExpedition Clothing sees gains similar to Saddle Bike Company, \nyour typical $100 per order sale would increase to $135, for a \ntotal annual revenue increase of $3.5 million, after installing \nSales Aide™ software and terminals.\nSee DISCRIMINATORS and \nFEATURES, ADVANTAGES, \nAND BENEFITS.\nWhile helpful, you do \nnot need to substantiate \nyour claim in the theme \nstatement, but you must \nsubstantiate your claim in \nthe proposal.\n2\t\nUSE THEME STATEMENTS CONSISTENTLY.\nPlace theme statements consistently \nthroughout the proposal at the beginning \nof every major section, subsection, or \nsummary. If you use theme statements in the first- and second-\nlevel sections, (section 3 and section 3.1, for instance), use \nthem for all first- and second-level sections. If you insert theme \nstatements at other points in the proposal, do it consistently.\nGive theme statements an identical appearance. Most theme \nstatements are visually emphasized to differentiate them from \nbody text, as illustrated in figure 1. The amount of emphasis \ncan vary from the minimal emphasis of a single-sentence \nopening paragraph in standard body text font to a large, bold, \ncolored font surrounded by white space, borders, shading, or \nother emphasis devices. \nWriters forced to create theme statements when they have no \ndiscriminating features will often draft poor, ineffective theme \nstatements. When too many theme statements are included, \nno matter where they are placed, evaluators have said, “We \nknew that was the marketing hype, so we ignored them.”\nSee PAGE AND  \nDOCUMENT DESIGN.\n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n287\n©Shipley Associates\n2.0 TITLE\nOur team of 47 software engineers has a combined \ntotal of over 600 years of experience designing, testing, \nand installing conversion software on time and within \nbudget.\n1 .

Different styles are appropriate for different customers and markets. \nSelect a tasteful, appropriate style for your customer and use it consistently throughout each proposal.\n3\t\nLINK BENEFITS TO FEATURES, TRYING TO STATE BENEFITS FIRST.\nEvaluators must see a clear, logical link between the benefit \nand the feature included in each theme statement. While every \nbenefit could plausibly be linked to lower cost, you do not \nhave to take them all that far.\nPoor example\nOur Easy Link™ software will reduce your cost. \nBetter example\nThe intuitive, graphical user interface of our Easy Link™ software can \nreduce your training time from 4 hours to 1 hour.\nCustomers buy benefits, not features. Improve the customer \nfocus of your theme statements by stating the benefit before \nthe feature. The impact is subtle but \nmakes the theme statement more \npersuasive.\nBest example\nReduce your training time from 4 hours to \n1 hour due to the intuitive, graphical user \ninterface of our Easy Link™ software.\nIf benefits and features \nare clearly linked and the \nfeatures are discrimina-\ntors, then you have an ef-\nfective theme statement.\nSee CUSTOMER \nFOCUS. \n4\t\nQUANTIFY BENEFITS IF POSSIBLE. \nTheme statements that include quantified benefits tend to be \nmore credible. \nTheme statement—benefit not quantified\nReduce order entry cost by installing e-Entry™ order entry software. \nTheme statement—benefit quantified\nReduce order handling cost 30 percent by installing e-Entry™ order \nentry software. \nQuantified benefits must be supportable. If you cannot support \nyour claims, change your theme statement. Support your \nclaims in the proposal shortly after making the claim. \nWhenever possible, quantify the benefits collaboratively with \nthe customer. Customers who help determine the potential \nbenefits of your solution are more likely to continue to believe \nthe calculation is correct. \n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n288\n©Shipley Associates\nState the quantified benefit realistically and precisely. Broad \ngeneralizations are perceived broadly; overly precise numbers \nwill not be believed. \nFor example, the 30 percent savings in the previous theme \nstatement will be interpreted as plus or minus 5 to 10 percent: \nTheme statement—benefit more precisely quantified\nReduce order handling cost 33 percent by installing e-Entry™ order \nentry software. \nDepending on how the calculations were completed, the \nfollowing theme statement borders on being too precise: \nTheme statement—benefit more precisely quantified\nReduce order handling cost 33.4 percent by installing e-Entry™ order \nentry software. \nThe following theme statement is too precise to be credible:\nTheme statement—benefit too precisely quantified\nReduce order handling cost 33.37 percent by installing e-Entry™ order \nentry software. \n5\t\nDRAFT CONCISE THEME STATEMENTS, PREFERABLY IN A SINGLE  \nCOMPLETE SENTENCE. \nThe longer the theme statement, the more likely the evaluator \nwill not read it. Writing short, concise, discriminating theme \nstatements can be difficult.\nIf you can remove any words in your theme statements \nwithout changing the meaning, do it. If you can use a shorter \nbut still accurate word, do it. If you can use a short, active verb \ninstead of jargon, do it.\nNote how following these recommendations improves the \nfollowing theme statement:\nPoor example\nOur integrated design process, incorporating the lessons learned on \nall earlier generation aircraft engines, has resulted in an engine that \nuses four common fastening systems for engine assembly, offering \nmaximum maintainability.\nToo many features confuse the reader. Which ones are most \nunique? Most sellers would claim to have an integrated design \nprocess and to incorporate lessons learned. \nBetter example\nOur engine uses four common fastening systems for maximum main-\ntainability.\nNow cut the jargon. Fastening systems are bolts; maximum \nmaintainability means easy to fix.\nBetter example\nWith only four common bolts used for assembly, our engine is easy \nto fix.\nThen put the benefit first.\nOur engine is easy to fix because only four common bolts are used for \nassembly.\nSave the proof for the section graphics and text. Do not try to \nincorporate complete proof in the theme statement.\nEvaluators tire from reading long theme statements. High-\nimpact theme statements resemble sound bites. If evaluators \nhad to justify why you should be selected, what should they \nsay? Draft selection justification statements for the evaluators \nin your theme statements.\nWith theme statements, a complete sentence is more likely to \ncontain both features and benefits. Theme statements that \nare incomplete sentences too frequently contain only features \nor only benefits. Good theme statements enable the reader to \nanswer both questions:  “So what?” and “How so?”\nOne way to test your theme statements is to read them aloud. \nMost theme statements that sound good are good. We can \nactually tolerate reading longer theme statements than we \ncan tolerate hearing them. If you have to take a breath when \nreading your theme statement, it is too long. Focus your \nthoughts and shorten your theme statements.\n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n289\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nDIFFERENTIATE SECTION THEME STATEMENTS AND SECTION SUMMARIES.\nWriters often create long theme statements that incorporate all \nof the key features and benefits discussed in the section. These \nlong theme statements make better section summaries. Use \nthem as the first paragraph in the section, then write a concise, \nfocused theme statement. \nNote how the following section summary is converted into a \nconcise, specific, and focused theme statement.\nSection Summary\nAll environmental waste cleanup services will be conducted by our \n75-person team, centrally located in Omaha, Nebraska. Ima Green \nhas successfully managed this team for 3 years, completing 22 clean-\nup actions on schedule and at or under budget. Team members are \nlicensed to perform all action requested in the bid request.\nSection Theme Statement\nIma Green’s team has completed 22 cleanup actions for your organi-\nzation during the past 3 years. All cleanup actions were on schedule \nand at or under budget.\nTo illustrate the difference between a section theme and a \nsection summary, try the following two-part exercise:\n1.\t Consider the place where you live. When you were looking for \nyour current residence, you probably saw several places at the \nsame price. Jot down the specific feature that prompted you \nto select the one where you live. Typical answers are location, \nspace, the fireplace, large garage, fenced yard, it was bright \nand airy, or it just felt good. \n2.\t Now write a one- or two-sentence description of the place where \nyou live. Typical descriptions read like a real estate agent’s \ndescription: \n“The home is a 2,000 sq. ft. brick rambler with 3 bedrooms, 2 \nfull baths, a full basement, located on a .25-acre lot near neigh-\nborhood schools.”\nForm a theme statement by linking discriminating features \nidentified in part one to a benefit. The second statement is a \nsummary. Emulate this in section themes.\n7\t\nENSURE BENEFITS GO BEYOND ADVANTAGES.\nBenefits are something that customers have acknowledged \nthey want and value. Benefits are owned by customers. \nAdvantages are potential benefits. Advantages sound good, \nbut customers may not actually want them. In some instances, \ncustomers might value the advantage, turning it into a benefit, \nonce they understand how it helps them. \nProposal writers cannot draft effective themes if they do not \nknow what customers value. Consider the following examples:\nYou can economically commute to work with this new hybrid gasoline-\nelectric auto, rated at 65 miles per gallon.\nWhat if the customer is looking for an auto to race in weekend \nroad rallies?\nYour fitness will improve rapidly when you use the Pro Star \nprogrammable treadmill for only 20 minutes, 4 days per week.\nWhat if the customer detests walking or running, lacks space \nto place a treadmill, lacks the initiative to work out alone, \nor simply does not care about personal fitness? Then the \ntreadmill offers this customer no benefit.\nOrganizations that use boilerplate extensively often have \nineffective themes in their proposals. The benefits, while \ndesirable, are often generic rather than specific and are not in \nthe customer’s terms.\nConsider a proposal to provide a telephone \nsystem to a business. A typical proposal \nincludes a list of 50 features of the phone system linked to the \nbenefit of each feature. Many customers see no need for 80 \npercent of the features, so the system appears over-specified, \ncomplex, and more expensive than necessary. Many of the \nremaining 20 percent of the features are linked to benefits that \nare not particularly appealing or useful to the customer. \nIn an attempt to cover all aspects of their system, sellers \nunintentionally turn away customers.\nSee FEATURES, \nADVANTAGES, \nAND BENEFITS.\n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n290\n©Shipley Associates\n8\t\nTAILOR YOUR THEME STRUCTURE AND APPROACH TO THE  \nEVALUATION PROCESS.\nProposal professionals advocate distinctly different standards \nfor theme statements, usually because a particular approach \nhas worked well in a specific market. All of the following \napproaches are used:\n1.\t Place a single theme statement only at the beginning of \nsections, typically at a uniform indenture level.\n2.\t Place a theme statement anywhere a significant \ndiscriminator is discussed.\n3.\t Place a series of theme statements at the beginning of \nmajor sections in a single box.\n4.\t Place a single theme statement at the top of every page.\nEach approach has potential advantages and disadvantages, \ndepending on how the proposal will be evaluated. Remember \nthat having focused, persuasive content is much more \nimportant than the number of theme statements and the \nplacement of those theme statements in your proposal.\nThe first two approaches are more effective in the less-\ndisciplined, more-casual approach to evaluation common in \nmany nongovernment market sectors. Short, concise theme \nstatements are more likely to be read and remembered when \nthe winner is being selected in a group discussion. The telling \ncomment from an evaluator is likely to be something like the \nfollowing: “I think we should go with Company A because \nthey were the only ones that . . .”  The evaluator’s justification \nusually mirrors a particularly effective, persuasive, and \nmemorable theme statement.\nThe first three approaches effectively capture the attention \nof skimmers. Skimmers are usually senior managers who play \na major role in the selection decision but are not assigned \na formal evaluation role. Skimmers read only the parts that \ncapture their interest.\nPlacing a single theme statement at \nthe beginning of the section requires \na writer to identify the single most \nimportant discriminator in the section \nand incorporate it into the theme \nstatement. The concept is correct, but the implementation is \nmore difficult.\nPlacing theme statements anywhere a significant \ndiscriminator is discussed suggests the seller has numerous \ndiscriminators. If a theme statement \ndirectly answers a specific bid request \nquestion or requirement, the highly \nvisible theme statement makes \nevaluation easy. \nThe risk in requiring theme statements at set points in a \nproposal is that writers might lack a discriminating feature, \nwriters must draft more theme statements, and often these \ntheme statements are not as focused and persuasive. \nEvaluators reading numerous theme statements are less likely \nto remember your major discriminators.\nThe third approach, placing a collection of themes in a single \nbox at the beginning of a section, has advantages in complex, \nformally solicited proposals with a detailed, disciplined \nevaluation process. The example in figure 2 demonstrates this \nprocess.\nSummarizing your response to the compliance requirements \nin a single place makes evaluation easy, potentially increasing \nyour score. However, individual evaluators at the item level \nhave minimal influence over the final selection. Evaluators \nwith decision-making power tend to skim proposals and are \nless likely to remember anything said in a collection of themes. \nThey are more likely to remember a single, concise statement.\nThe fourth approach, placing themes at the top of every \npage, is the least-effective choice. Evaluators tend to perceive \nthemes at the top of the page as headers and ignore them. \nWriters forced to draft a theme for every page tend to draft \nineffective, general, and less-persuasive theme statements.\nTheme statements are things you say in the proposal to \nsupport your strategy. Writers have alternative devices to \ntheme statements to emphasize their strategy in a proposal, \nspecifically, informative headings, action captions, pull quotes, \nand margin theme statements. Each emphasis device is \nexplained below: \n•\t Informative headings are similar to themes, even if they \ndo not incorporate both features and benefits.\n•\t Action captions include features and benefits, but they \ncan be longer than themes. The graphic seems to prompt \npeople to eagerly read long captions when they refuse to \nread long themes. \n•\t Pull quotes, often found in magazine articles, resemble \nthemes. Pull quotes are literally quotes pulled from \nthe text and displayed in a larger point size, often in \nthe margin or with body text wrapped around them. \nReaders tend to remember items that are repeated and \nemphasized.\n•\t Margin theme statements are often placed in page \nmargins adjacent to where the point is supported, \nanywhere in a proposal section. Margin quotes are \neffective. Consider using them in all proposals. \nThe only difference \nbetween pull quotes \nand margin themes is \nwhether the statement \nis identical to what is \nsaid in body text.\nSee ACTION \nCAPTIONS; FEATURES, \nADVANTAGES, AND \nBENEFITS; and \nHEADINGS.\n\nTheme Statements\nShipley Proposal Guide\n291\n©Shipley Associates\nCO M P L I A N C E  R E Q U I R E M E N T\nT H E M E  S TAT E M E N T\nINDICATE YOUR APPROACH TO  \nSITE REMEDIATION\nTHE KLEAN TEAM WILL REMEDIATE EACH SITE \nIN A  RAPID, COST EFFECTIVE MANNER BY:\nDiscuss cost-effective practices,....................................\njob site safety,.................................................................\nteam structure,...............................................................\nand how you will use subcontractors, if relevant............\t\n•\t Eliminating double handling of material\n•\t Loading trucks with identical material to eliminate decontamination\n•\t Limiting team size by assigning individuals qualified to handle several jobs\n•\t Using specialized subcontractors wherever they are available, qualified, and \ncost competitive\nFigure 2. Limit Grouped Themes to Formally Evaluated and Solicited Proposals. Grouped themes reflect individual section compliance \nrequirements. In this example, compliance requirements are listed on the left. The corresponding group theme is shown on the right. Grouped \nthemes are typically placed at the beginning of a proposal section. A similar alternative is to place a benefit-feature matrix at the beginning of \neach proposal section that reflects the compliance requirements.\n9\t\nUSE THE THEME LITMUS TEST TO ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF YOUR  \nTHEME STATEMENTS.\nChemists use litmus paper to quickly discriminate acidic \nand basic solutions. Writers can use the theme litmus test \nto quickly discriminate effective and ineffective theme \nstatements.\nCan you honestly answer “No,” then “Yes” to both of the \nfollowing questions?\nIf not, then refine your theme statement. Try to make your \nfeature more specific until it is unique. Then try to make the \nbenefits more precise. Try to quantify the benefits. \nWhile not foolproof, these questions can help you detect \nthemes that require improvement. Eliminate jargon, slogans, \nand platitudes from your theme statements. Consider the \nfollowing examples:\nPoor\nElbonia Telephone has committed to partnering with the Elbonian \nNavy to assure success.\nImproved\nThe Elbonian Navy can eliminate the cost of purchasing their own \ncommunications satellite by leasing encrypted and secure channels \nfrom the Elbonia Telephone satellite network.\nPoor\nMaster Constructors is uniquely qualified to manage your project.\nImproved\nAs the only company to ever construct a bridge of this type and length, \nwe will assign the same project manager and construction superin-\ntendent to better ensure completion on time and within budget.\nCould the competition plausibly \nmake the same claim?\nCould an evaluator cut-and-paste this \ntheme statement into an evaluation \nform to justify giving you the highest \nrating for a factor or subfactor?\nYES?\nNO?\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n292\n©Shipley Associates\nVIRTUAL TEAM MANAGEMENT\nTeams are groups of people with complementary skills \nwho are committed to a common goal. Virtual teams are \ngroups of people who primarily interact \nelectronically and may occasionally meet \nface-to-face to accomplish a common \ngoal. Whether virtual or co-located, \nproposal teams have the same goal: \npreparing a winning proposal.\nOrganizations are driven by several \nfactors to increasingly deploy virtual teams to complete a \nvariety of tasks, including crafting proposals. The primary \nenablers and drivers are: \n•\t Increase in web connectivity and web collaboration tools\n•\t Increase in travel costs \n•\t Increase in employees working from home or remote \nlocations\n•\t Expansion of multinational organizations\n•\t Expansion of services that do not require a central \nproduction site\n•\t Access to lower labor costs in emerging markets or unique \npersonnel in remote locations\nResearch on high-performance teams and virtual team \nmanagement is extensive and active. Here are some trends in \nhow organizations use virtual teams: \n•\t Co-located proposal teams predominantly serve \norganizations that sell larger, more complex, higher-risk \nsystems.\n•\t More organizations are using virtual proposal teams for \nlarge, complex bids that were once prepared exclusively \nby co-located teams.\n•\t Most proposal teams have virtual contributors, and most \ncontributors operate virtually to some extent.\nVirtual teams do sometimes fail. Senior management and \nvirtual team managers will sometimes need to shift to a \npartially or fully co-located team. \nThe following guidelines focus on aspects of virtual team \nmanagement that differ or require greater emphasis than \nwhen managing a co-located team. \nVirtual proposal teams are both increasingly common and necessary. Proposal managers must complete the same tasks in a virtual \nenvironment that are required when managing a co-located team.\nOrganizations are \nincreasingly using \nvirtual teams to \nprepare large, \ncomplex bids \nthat were once \nexclusively prepared \nby co-located teams.\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n293\n©Shipley Associates\nVIRTUAL TEAM MANAGEMENT\nExploit the advantages and compensate \nfor the challenges of virtual teams.\nEstablish and maintain a \nhigh-trust environment.\nDefine and assign key virtual \nteam roles clearly.\n1\n2\n3\nOver-communicate.\nDistinguish team management, leadership, \nand member motivation.\n6\n7\nEstablish clearly defined, discrete tasks.\n4\nEstablish virtual meeting ground rules.\nEstablish a rigorous review structure.\n8\n9\nSelect task-appropriate, \neasy-to-use technology.\n5\n1 \t\nEXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGES AND COMPENSATE FOR THE CHALLENGES  \nOF VIRTUAL TEAMS.\nMany organizations, business development managers, and \nproposal managers prefer co-locating their entire team, but \nhave little choice; they must increasingly use virtual proposal \nteams to offset the challenges shown in figure 1. \nVirtual proposal team managers face social and technology \nchallenges. The social challenges require managing, \nmotivating, and coaching team members. The technology \nchallenges require tools to monitor tasks, schedules, and \nperformance quality and are usually easier to address. \nTechnical challenges are addressed in guideline 5.\nCommon social challenges are low individual commitment, \nrole overload, role ambiguity, absenteeism, social loafing, and \nlimited and/or conflicting management priorities. Consider \nthese social challenges:\n•\t Team members in different time zones dislike \ninconveniently scheduled meetings.\n•\t Critical decisions are delayed because key people cannot \nfind common meeting times.\n•\t Email or off-hand teleconference comments are \nmisconstrued, causing confusion and distrust.\n•\t Time and resources are wasted because multiple team \nmembers unknowingly work on the same task.\n•\t Isolated team members feel left out and are minimally \ncommitted to the team objective.\n•\t Managers who do not benefit from team success direct \nteam members to work on other tasks. \n•\t Team members can hide poor performance and then \nblame technology, management, lack of information, or \nother team members.\nThe recommendations in subsequent guidelines will help \nvirtual proposal managers overcome these challenges.\nISSUE\nADVANTAGES\nCHALLENGES\nFlexibility \nRapidly form, execute, and disband teams.\nCumbersome to manage and motivate people over time and distance.\nResources \nAssign the best talent available across \ntime, space, and cultures.\nLoss of effectiveness due to low individual commitment to team goal.

Advantages and Challenges of Virtual Proposal Teams. Virtual teams offer a number of advantages and challenges. \n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n294\n©Shipley Associates\n2 \t ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A HIGH-TRUST ENVIRONMENT.\nResearchers overwhelmingly agree that trust is the key \nprerequisite for an effective team. However, trust develops \ndifferently in co-located and virtual teams. Trusting team \nmembers exhibit these characteristics:\n•\t Admit weaknesses and mistakes to each other.\n•\t Request help and assist members outside their area of \nresponsibility.\n•\t Accept questions and suggestions openly without \ndefensiveness.\n•\t Give others the benefit of the doubt.\n•\t Risk offering constructive feedback.\n•\t Disclose their agendas and motivations.\n•\t Offer and accept apologies without reservation.\n•\t Look forward to meetings and team interaction.\n•\t Seek to understand others’ viewpoints and perspectives.\n•\t Share responsibility for overall project success.\n•\t Avoid dysfunctional behaviors, such as blaming, attacking, \nrescuing, or playing the victim. \nManagers face a number of obstacles to developing trust within \na virtual proposal team. Members bring expectations and \npotential fears from prior virtual experiences. They must learn \nto trust team management and other members in spite of the \nrisk factors inherent in time, distance, and cultural separation. \nIn addition, tight deadlines leave little time to build trust. \nBecause team members may be less willing to participate in \na high-risk, low-trust situation, managers must mitigate risks \nand build trust to enable full team participation.\nVirtual proposal managers can rapidly build and maintain trust \nby adapting their communication techniques to convey a clear \nsense of action, support, and constructive feedback. \nBegin by defining the objective, member roles, individual \ntasks, and expectations. Trust erodes quickly if objectives, \nroles, tasks, and expectations are blurred, unclear, or fluid. \nBalance pre-kickoff strategy and solution development \nactivities. Target 75 percent completion of strategy and \nsolution development pre-kickoff, especially when submittal \ndeadlines are one week or less. This compromise supports an \nearlier kickoff and fosters members’ input, buy-in, acceptance, \nand identification with the team. Begin with a face-to-face \nkickoff meeting, if you can afford the expense and travel time.\nTeam members that sense clear, decisive, management and \nmember action remain confident the team will manage the \nuncertainty and risk inherent in preparing winning proposals. \nUse the communication techniques summarized in figure 2 to \nestablish high levels of trust early and maintain trust as you \nprepare the proposal. \nTECHNIQUES TO BUILD TRUST EARLY\nTECHNIQUES TO MAINTAIN TRUST\nEncourage non-task, social communication. Foster comments on \nhobbies, activities, families, etc. and integrate with other exchanges. \nSet up an online, shared-space where team members can post their \npictures, bios, and other social items. However, do not allow social \ncommunication to substitute for progress on tasks.\nCommunicate predictably. Set and maintain all meeting times, balancing \nthe demands on members in different time zones. Explain every change \nor absence in advance. Avoid irregular, inequitable, and unpredictable \ncommunication. During a crisis, maintain near-real-time communication. \nMaintain a consistent style and tone in all communication.\nCommunicate optimistically and enthusiastically. Promote team \nas a virtual family. Use we. Encourage positive comments among \nmembers. Discourage negative remarks.\nDevelop schemes to deal with technical and task uncertainty. Have three \nor more ways to connect with team members (email addresses, both home \nand work; phone numbers for work, cell, team buddy, manager(s), and key \nco-worker(s); instant messaging; and perhaps, social media links)\nDevelop schemes to handle task and technology uncertainty. \nNumber and date the messages and meeting notes consecutively \nso members can place them in context and detect missing items. \nConfront and promptly handle vague statements, allegations, and \ncomplaints. Publicize members’ activity and inactivity. Encourage \nexchanges that clarify and develop consensus.\nEncourage proactive action. Reward and praise individual and sub-team \ncommitment and accomplishment. Communicate positively, concisely, and \nspecifically. Avoid weak, vague, or equivocal statements. \n\t\nWeak: Complete in 4 or 5 days.\n\t\nStronger: Submit before 3:30 PM on Thursday.\nState exactly how you will manage. First impressions are critical. \nEmphasize performance, not behavior. State how you will manage \nmissed deadlines. Members tend to respond similarly to how they \nare initially treated.\nRespond promptly, explicitly, and predictably to all messages. Low-trust \nteams characteristically get little feedback from managers or members.\nClarify roles, procedures, and quality standards. Be unequivocal. \nThen transition from procedural to task focus.\nAssign task leadership based upon skill, ability, interest, and enthusiasm. \nFocus on, praise, and reward on-time completion of initial tasks. \nSay what you mean, and mean what you say. Laud good perfor-\nmance; praise in public.\nUse peer pressure constructively. Continue to praise good performance. \nNote impacts of substandard performance; scold in private; escalate re-\npeated poor performance; eliminate non-performers.\nFigure 2. Team Communications Strategies Establish and Maintain High Trust. Your communication with your virtual proposal team and \nmembers’ communication among themselves are the only means that you have to develop and maintain the member trust needed to prepare a \nwinning proposal.\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n295\n©Shipley Associates\n3\t\nDEFINE AND ASSIGN KEY VIRTUAL TEAM ROLES CLEARLY.\nRoles for virtual proposal teams are subtly different than \ntypical proposal team roles. The same tasks must be \ncompleted, but the roles shift. Key virtual proposal team roles \nand descriptions follow. \nManager/Facilitator: Encompasses the traditional proposal \nmanager role and often some of the proposal coordinator role. \nAs with the proposal manager role, the primary responsibility \nis to prepare a compliant, responsive, winning proposal. \nAssign others to develop the solution and pricing. The primary \ntasks are to facilitate team meetings and manage participants.\nParticipants: As with co-located proposal teams, participants \nare contributors. Their primary responsibility is to produce a \ncompliant responsive proposal section and/or other assigned, \nscheduled tasks.\nTechnologist: Similar in many respects to the proposal \ncoordinator role, the technologist sets up virtual meetings and \nworkspaces. The technologist also handles security and access \nissues, and coaches/trains participants to use the technology \ncorrectly. Ideally, the technologist supports multiple proposals \nin a consistent manner so that participants who contributed to \nprior virtual proposals can use the same tools and procedures \nas before, reducing training costs and start-up delays.\nOwners: Whether a single person or \nmultiple people, owners sponsor and \npay for the proposal. Owners are usually \nnot the sales lead, but have overall \nresponsibility to win the opportunity.\nBoard of Champions: The ideal \nChampion is two or three levels \nabove the participant and not the immediate supervisor. \nChampions have the authority and big-picture vision to \nreplace participants, free participants from conflicting direct \nmanagement assignments, and offer additional direct \nsupport. Immediate supervisors often have split or conflicting \ninterests in that they must oversee \nmembers’ regular responsibilities \nwhile members are contributing \nto the proposal. Dual or split \nassignments exacerbate the \nproblems. \nSee TEAM SELECTION \nAND MANAGEMENT; \nAPPENDIX A, Business \nDevelopment Lifecy-\ncle Guide for descrip-\ntions of traditional \nproposal team roles.\nKnowing when to ask for \nhelp is difficult, especially \nwith short deadlines. In \ngeneral, make specific \nrequests for action. \nAvoid presenting vaguely \nformulated problems. Take \nyour question to a coach \nor mentor, someone that \nyou can talk to openly and \nconstructively.\n4 \t ESTABLISH CLEARLY DEFINED, DISCRETE TASKS.\nWhile this recommendation applies to any team, it is vital \nfor virtual team success. In a face-to-face environment, \nteam members are more likely to ask questions, and \nmanagers can more easily view work products. In a virtual \nenvironment, participants tend to overstate their progress and \nmisunderstand instructions.\nIn co-located team environments, proposal managers can \nestablish major tasks and milestones to quickly get the team \nstarted, and then prepare smaller tasks and completion dates \nto more precisely track progress. \nIn a virtual environment, begin with more task granularity. If you \ndo not, team members tend to think that their task assignments \nare being changed mid-course, and they lose commitment \nto the project. With virtual teams, inch-stone tasks help you \nidentify late tasks before they threaten your schedule.\nUse these questions to determine if your tasks are clearly \ndefined:\n•\t Is the task sized? For example, 2 pages, 4 hrs. of \nengineering time, or limited to work at the Erie facility.\n•\t Is the due date precise? For example, 10:00 AM EST, \nTuesday, February 4, 20XX.\n•\t Is the person responsible named? Naming a position or \ngroup is seldom sufficient.\n•\t Are quality standards defined or referenced? For \nexample: Sections must have theme statements and all \nfigures must have action captions. Sections must be spell \nchecked before submitting.\n•\t How will you verify task completion? Normally you verify \nwhen you receive a file, or when something that you can \nsee, hear, or touch is delivered.\n•\t How will you escalate responsibility if this task deadline \nis missed? Disclose the quantified impact on subsequent \nmilestones, and possibly name the person you will \nescalate responsibility to.\nSee SCHEDULING, \nguideline 6.\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n296\n©Shipley Associates\n5 \t SELECT TASK-APPROPRIATE, EASY-TO-USE TECHNOLOGY.\nMatch technology to task complexity. Small virtual teams can \nbe managed using email, scheduling, and word processing \ntools. Larger, more complex teams require more sophisticated \ntools. Advice on tool selection is well beyond the purpose of \nthis Guide, and these tools are evolving rapidly.\nVirtual teams work in an online, collaborative workspace. \nParticipants’ work should be open and available to managers \nto monitor progress. Managers often need to control team \nmembers’ ability to view and modify files. Typically, team \nmembers check out files, modify those files, and then resave \nmodified files in the shared workspace. While some tools \nsupport team members’ simultaneous access to the same file, \nmany proposals are too large for this approach.\nThe easier the technology is to use, the better. Participants \nmust be comfortable with the technology before they can \nfocus on completing assigned tasks. Give participants hands-\non tool training, not just a demonstration of the tool being \nused by an expert user. \nHere are a few suggestions on using virtual team management tools:\nWhen the proposal has been submitted, archive documents to your company’s file storage and close the online workspace. \nUse familiar technology as much as possible. For example, if you routinely use specific email, scheduling, \nand online meeting technology, use the same technology for the proposal. \nEstablish 24/7 technical support. When participants in multiple locations and time \nzones lose access to files and shared workspaces, they begin working off-line and use \nlost access to justify late deliverables. Integrate live and online support. Even when \nthe technologist is on-duty, every team member cannot be helped simultaneously. \nAutomatically back up files daily. Time-stamp files in case you need to \nreturn to prior versions.\nBe clear and decisive about technology issues. Do not tolerate member resistance on \ntechnology and tools. Even if member suggestions are valid, you lack time for discussion \nand adaptation. Members perceive indecision as a weakness in proposal management.\nEstablish and maintain consistent procedures. Use identical passwords, call numbers, call \ntimes, agendas, and forms. \nConsider interoperability issues. Prime contractors, subcontractors, and teaming partners need to be able to \nwork together compatibly while protecting proprietary and limited-access data. Address these issues before \nthey impact your proposal.\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n297\n©Shipley Associates\n6\t\nOVER-COMMUNICATE. \nOne of the surest ways to lose member trust is to communicate \ninfrequently or sporadically. One veteran virtual proposal \nmanager reports that she routinely uses three modes for every \nmessage: text message, voicemail, and email. The greater the \nurgency, the greater the need to use more communication \nmodes. \n•\t Adapt your communication style to your corporate and \nteam members’ local culture, and within reason, to the \npreferred style of the participant. Some members resent \nmessages that clog their email accounts, especially \nwhen sent to both home and work accounts. Members in \nsome cultures object to messages sent to their homes, \npreferring to distinctly separate work from private life. \nHowever, most team members see communication as a \nsign that the proposal is important, their assigned task is \nimportant, and their team leader cares. They will realize \nthat team and organizational needs often outweigh \npersonal preferences.\n•\t Keep your messages short and to the point. Use \ninformative subject lines containing signal words. State \nthe essence of your message in the email subject line. \n•\t Keep voicemail messages under 2 minutes.\n•\t Leave your return phone number at the beginning and \nend of your message. A good practice is to prompt \nthe listener to prepare to write down your number by \nsaying, “I will repeat my phone number at the end of this \nmessage.” Improve the callback rate by saying your phone \nnumber clearly, slowly, and then repeat your number. Do \nnot assume that the listener will or can use the voicemail \nplayback feature, or that the caller ID will display your \nnumber.\n•\t Limit web conferences to 30 minutes and never exceed 50 \nminutes. If you need more time, take a break and resume \nor schedule another meeting. \n•\t Consider establishing a secure proposal team blog where \nparticipants can post questions and share information. \nOtherwise, every question is unaddressed until the next \nmeeting, directed through a management chain, or \nignored.\n7\t\nDISTINGUISH TEAM MANAGEMENT, LEADERSHIP, AND MEMBER MOTIVATION.\nProposals are not managed by group consensus; the proposal \nmanager is in control. However, control is complicated in \ntemporary, task-focused teams when the manager/facilitator is \nnot the direct manager of team members. \nTo compensate for a tenuous control position, effective virtual \nproposal managers must lead as well as manage. Managers \ncontrol, but leaders inspire and motivate. Managers get people \nto do what the managers want; leaders get people to want \nwhat the leaders want.\nManagement entails clearly defining tasks, quality standards, \nschedules, and key roles. Managers then assign the best \navailable people and train members when necessary. Both \nsponsors and champions must understand team members’ \nroles, responsibilities, and schedules. \nEffective virtual proposal mangers lead, as noted in \nguideline 2, by fostering early trust among the group, and by \nmaintaining member trust until tasks are completed. Effective \nleaders emphasize the common objectives of winning the \ndeal; being successful; contributing to their organization, \nteam, and industry; and serving the customer. Effective leaders \nalso recognize and adapt their communication style to team \nmembers’ unique interests, motivations, circumstances, and \ncultures.\n...effective \nvirtual proposal \nmanagers must \nlead as well as \nmanage.\n“ \n”\n\nVirtual Team Management\nShipley Proposal Guide\n298\n©Shipley Associates\n8 \t ESTABLISH VIRTUAL MEETING GROUND RULES.\nVirtual meetings present additional challenges. Face-to-\nface communication integrates visual, vocal, and verbal \nelements such as body language, gestures, movement, \nposture, and appearance. Vocal elements are how words are \nsaid, pronounced, and emphasized. Verbal elements are \ncomposition, word choice, and order. \nIn videoconference meetings, the quality of visual elements \nis degraded. People can step out of camera range or turn the \ncamera off. Video quality is often compromised, especially \nwith lower fidelity web conferencing equipment. Images can \nbe small, jerky, and low-resolution.\nVirtual proposal team managers can partially compensate for \nthese challenges by establishing virtual meeting ground rules \nsimilar to those found in figure 3.\nEffectively managing virtual proposal teams may be \nchallenging but is well worth the effort when the result is a \nwinning proposal.\nPRE-MEETING\nDURING MEETING\nPOST-MEETING\n•\t Make attendance mandatory. \nAnyone not able to attend must \nappoint a replacement and notify \nthe meeting facilitator. Announce \nreplacements when the meeting \nbegins.\n•\t Define in writing all roles and the \nauthority and responsibility of \neach role. These role definitions \ncan be used from proposal to \nproposal. Participants represent \nand make decisions for their \ngroups. Participants cannot go \nback to their organizations for \napproval.\n•\t Have an agenda for all meetings. \nDistribute a detailed, written \nagenda to participants before \nmajor meetings, allowing \nparticipants reasonable time to \nprepare for the meeting. Informal \nmeetings can be effective with a \nverbal agenda.\n•\t Ask your technologist to be \navailable for every meeting \nuntil you are confident that \nall participants can enter the \nmeeting and use the chosen \nmeeting tools. If the technology \nor team is new, test all systems \nbefore the meeting.\n•\t Enforce a culture of on-time call-ins, verbal identification \nof participants and purposes, and announcements of early \ndepartures. \n Virtual meetings must be as professional as regular meetings. Insist \nthat participants focus on the meeting rather than completing other \nwork, checking and answering email, or other personal matters.\n•\t Begin by summarizing the agenda items, meeting ground rules, \nand schedule. Seek acceptance, and then keep your word. \n•\t Appoint a note-taker to keep meeting minutes. Facilitators cannot \neffectively facilitate and take notes.\n•\t Appoint a timekeeper. The timekeeper can be the note-taker or any \nparticipant except the facilitator.\n•\t Poll participants for acceptance after each agenda item. Obtain \nclosure and summarize each agenda item before going to the next \nitem, even if your decision is to postpone discussion or to take the \ndiscussion to a different group.\n•\t When assigning tasks, ask the assignee to restate their \nunderstanding and acceptance of the tasks. \n Note that the assignee is responsible for completing the task, either \nby themselves or through others. Emphasize that task owners need \nnot be the expert or the doer, just that they must get the task done.\n•\t Remain positive, proactive, and precise. Commend good \nperformance. Note marginal performance by addressing the team \nrather than blaming individuals. For example, if pricing input is \nlate, do not say: Why is your pricing late? When will you submit \nthe pricing? Instead, say: Is the pricing team having any particular \ndifficulty developing the price? Is there anything that I can do to \nhelp your team complete the pricing? \n Note that you will address repeated poor performance off-line. Team \nmembers should not get the impression that poor performance is \ntolerated.\n•\t Close each meeting by reviewing agreements, tasks, completion \ntimes, and responsible individuals.\n•\t Close the meeting on time, noting that you did so. If you can close \nearly, note it and point out that participants have x minutes of \nadditional time.\n•\t Distribute minutes \nimmediately after \nthe meeting, \ndocumenting \nagreements, tasks, \ncompletion times, \nand responsible \nindividuals.\n•\t Immediately \naddress poor \nperformance off-line \nwith the assignee. If \nyou must escalate to \nthe relevant Board \nChampion, tell \nthem what you are \ndoing, and then do \nit. Team members \nlearn about empty \nthreats. When \ndeadlines are short, \nyou often cannot \nafford second \nchances, and never \nthird chances.\nFigure 3. Potential Virtual Meeting Ground Rules.

Quire\nPurchasing Manager\nBig Corporation\nWinston Street\nSan Diego, CA 92114\nSubject: Request to modify Big Corporation’s IT outsourcing RFP to reduce cost and enhance flexibility\nDear Art:\nTo better meet Big Corporation’s IT outsourcing objectives of reduced cost and enhanced flexibility, we \nrecommend two changes in your RFP dated December 15, 20XX. Our recommended changes will help Big \nCorporation meet its objectives while obtaining more competitive bids. To ensure our proposal is fully compliant \nand responsive, a prompt decision is critical.\nFor each recommended modification, we have quoted your RFP, explained our reasoning, and offered a draft RFP \ntext replacement. We request two modifications.\n1.\tTo reduce your cost and improve flexibility, eliminate the 10-year firm fixed price provision.\nCurrent provision:\t\nAll bidders must quote firm fixed prices for each and every year of the  \n10-year contract.\nComments:\t\nThe uncertainty of inflation in out-years will force all bidders to increase prices \nto cover inflation risk. Any increase or decrease in the type or level of services \nrequired will limit Big Corporation’s flexibility to adjust. You could be locked into old \ntechnologies and unable to quickly respond to your customers.\nRecommended change: \t\nAll bidders must quote firm, fixed prices on each task, with the annual cost being \nthe simple sum of the cost of all tasks. All required tasks and task pricing will be \nreviewed annually.\n2.\tTo improve flexibility by easing the restriction on any change in key positions. \nCurrent provision:\t\nAll bidders must name all persons proposed for all key positions, and no \nsubstitutions are permitted.\nComments:\t\nAs written, the provision could be interpreted to apply from the proposal stage \nthrough the entire 10-year term of the contract. Big Corporation’s requirements \nlikely will change, requiring different skills in key positions. Individuals also may \nchange jobs or even choose to retire. Allowing changes with your approval will \npermit both organizations to employ the best person available to meet the current \nneed.\nRecommended change:\t\nAll bidders must name all persons proposed for all key positions. Substitutions are \npermitted only after review and approval by Big Corporation’s designated contract \nadministrator.\nIT PARTNERS, INC.\nwww.itpartnerinc.com\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\nThe informative subject line \nbegins with the signal word \nlabeling the letter as a request.

TimberLands Chairman Wilson Pitt set the following strategic \ndirection:\nWe have to do everything better, more efficiently from a cost point of view, more effectively \nfrom an impact point of view. \n\t\n\t\nCascadia Timber Annual Report, 20XX\nTimberLands’ Forest Management Division helps improve efficiency and effectiveness by \nadopting innovative forest management practices.\nIn support of Timberlands’ strategic direction, the Forest Management Division verbally requested \nproposals for 50 UAVs to be used as a forest management tool. In our meetings with Forest \nManagement and purchasing, we agreed that TimberLands could anticipate the following added \nvalues:\n1.\t Reduced road construction and maintenance of $500,000 annually\n2.\t Reduced fire losses of $250,000 annually\n3.\t Reduced fire fighting costs of $250,000 annually\n \nTimberlands budgets $5 million annually for road construction and maintenance to permit \naccess for both harvesting and forest management. We agreed that a 10 percent reduction in road \nmaintenance costs, $500,000, was reasonable if foresters could monitor forest \nconditions from the air.\nTo ensure accurate and safe observation in all conditions, the BR-85 Drone \noffers positive stability, the ideal control response. During level flight, the pilot \ncan concentrate on observation with real-time feedback. For stable observation during turns, the \nUAV maintains a uniform attitude instead of seeking to return to a flat attitude. \nReduced road  \nconstruction and  \nmaintenance of  \n$500,000 annually\nFigure 1. Proven in Use. While no forest management group \ncurrently uses any type of UAV, the BR-85 Drone has been proven in \nsimilar operations with Special Forces personnel since 20XX.\nIn 10 years of flying \nthe Explorer for Special \nForces, we have been \nimpressed with the \ndurability and portabil-\nity of the aircraft after \nsuccessive airdrops in \ndifficult terrain. Airwind’s \nenthusiastic support was \nsuperb.\n-Maj.

O. Sparks, estimated \nthat rapid, in-air fire management could cut average losses by half. With \n50 fires annually, average losses of 500 acres, and timber losses of $1000 per acre, the annual loss \navoidance is $250,000. \nWhile many drones are used for recreation, the BR-85 Drone’s unique \n5-year use by Special Forces personnel over similar terrain and more \ndifficult conditions reduces risks in fire management support operations. \nMr. Sparks further noted that early detection would cut fire fighting cost per incident by $50,000. \nWith 50 incidents, the annual savings is $250,000. \nCapital Is Available\nTimberLands can purchase 50 BR-85 Drones from Airwind for $5,500 each, less than 20% of the \ncost of a 3/4 ton, four-wheel drive truck. With these trucks estimated to cost $40,000 each, reducing \nthe annual number purchased by 7 will free budgeted capital dollars for this drone purchase.\nSafe and Easy to Operate and Manage\nSafe and easy operation requires good design and excellent pilot training. BR-85 Drone’s design \noffers clear benefits:\nBenefit\nFeature\nExcellent pilot control\nIntegrated transmitter that gives the pilot full control\nHigh visibility sensor\nExtensive ISO range for low-light environments\nRugged\nSurvived sixteen drops without damage\nSafe, effective training\nAward-winning training program\nTimberLands foresters can focus on forest management \nbecause the BR-85 Drone is easily maintained. Routine \nchecks of updated software, snap-lock bolts, fittings, and \nsimple preflight tests are sufficient for safe operation. \nWeekly checks of landing gear, and the camera sensors \nare required. Annual battery chargers and in-depth \nchecks of the working components are required and can \nbe done at TimberLands’ convenience by Airwind personnel.\nReliable, rugged flight instruments, proven in 10 years of use, require only annual calibration. \nTimberLands has kept on the leading edge of innovative forest management techniques. Airwind \nwelcomes the opportunity to contribute over $1 million in added value to TimberLands’ bottom \nline by supplying 50 BR-85 Drones, flight and maintenance training, \nand long-term maintenance and inspection support.\nOur proposal mirrors the issues discussed in our meetings.

All \nmandatory requirements are \nmet. \nThe GPS2 dropsonde \nexceeds all subsystem \nspecifications and objectives \nand provides extended \nfunctionality with lightning \nsensing. \n System Design \n Design Characteristics \n System Construction \n Documentation \n Logistics \n2.1 System Design \nReduced weight, reduced cost, and a new measurement function drove our technical approach. \nAs emphasized in your RFP, our primary focus is on enhancements to the dropsonde, but the \nentire system of dropsondes, ORDP, and ground station were considered. \nTo enhance performance and reduce dropsonde weight, we will \nincorporate an integrated measurement system-on-a-chip to replace the \ncombination analog/solid state system in the current GPS dropsonde. \nTo alleviate expensive change-out of current flight systems, we \nmaintained identical mechanical and electrical interfaces. While GPS2 \ndropsondes are lighter (only 199 g each), interfaces are identical. \nWe have maintained the current Newmanix DLS-100 as the ORDP. The rugged DLS-100, used \nin military applications as the ARGOS I, has been proven over ten years of Hurricane Hunter \noperations with the U. S. Air Force’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron. \nEntirely rethinking the traditional, custom-build approach to ground stations, we propose a \nsimple data receiver, hooked to a Mac Book Pro driving multiple displays, and a broadband \nwireless Web link to relay data to ESRL scientists. \nWhile a later acquisition may include the on-board dropsonde dispenser, our design continues to \nrely upon current single-dropsonde launch tubes. Should ESRL decide to optimize the dispenser \nsystem with the reduced weight of our GPS2 dropsonde, we welcome the opportunity to discuss \npotential designs. \n2.1.1 Technical Functional Description \nImproved GPS2 Dropsonde Package \nThe GPS2 dropsonde (shown in descent in Figure 2-2) provides high-resolution vertical profiles \nof temperature, pressure, and humidity. During descent, the dropsonde also senses eye-wall \nlightning and dropsonde location and radios these data back to the ORDP aboard the aircraft. The \nORDP receives these data real-time from up to four dropsondes simultaneously. \nEach dropsonde determines its position continuously by autonomously \nprocessing signals from GPS satellites. Winds are not sensed directly by \nthe dropsonde, but calculated by the ORDP from the time-varying GPS \npositions and Doppler frequencies. \nThe dropsonde’s 8-channel codeless GPS receiver determines Doppler \nfrequencies of the carrier signals from GPS satellites. These Doppler \n1 0 - P R O P O S A L  S E C T I O N :  F O R M A L LY  S O L I C I T E D  G O V E R N M E N T  P R O P O S A L\n9\nProof of performance  must \nbe integrated into the \nproposal as relevant and \nnot left to a separate, past \nperformance section.\n9\n7\n8\nLarge proposal sections may \ninclude an introduction when \nspace is available.\n7\n8\n10\n10\nCallout boxes draw attention \nto key statements in support of \nyour solution.\nThe writer offers sufficient \nbackground information to \nboth educate an inexperienced \nevaluator and demonstrate \nunderstanding of the \nrequirement.

Next Generation Performance. With the addition of system-on-a-chip sensors and a \nlighter weight canister, the Windslow GPS2 is a cost-effective solution. Advanced design and \nlightweight composites enable Windslow’s GPS2 to exceed requirements. \n \nWe increased the size of the inverted, pyramidal parachute—used reduce initial shock load and \nthen slow and stabilize the dropsonde—by 9 percent. Tests at our Birmingham, AL, facilities \nconfirmed that the parachute alteration and reduced dropsonde weight reduced descent rate to \nless than 8 m/sec, well under the 10 m/sec DUDS specification. The parachute reduces or \neliminates dropsonde pendulum motion. \nTo reduce dropsonde weight, Windslow selected Cornsonite®, a low-cost, biodegradable, corn-\nderived cellulose and plastic composite that is lighter and yet more durable than the existing \nplasticized fiberboard canister. To verify durability, this composite was thoroughly tested in our \nenvironmental chambers and real-world applications. After some manufacturing adjustments, \nCornsonite® has met expectations in 30 simulated drop tests. \n1 0 - P R O P O S A L  S E C T I O N :  F O R M A L LY  S O L I C I T E D  G O V E R N M E N T  P R O P O S A L\n11\n12\n12\n11\nTie benefits and features of \nyour solution back to the \nrequirements and show \ncompliance.\nThe tabular, summary \npresentation of \nperformance specifications \nmakes evaluation easy. \n\nModel Documents\nShipley Proposal Guide\n319\n©Shipley Associates\n \nWindslow Technologies \nRFP RA123-R-0X-RP-1234 \n \nVolume II Technical/Management \n11 \nRapid improvements in technology have enabled us to replace the current suite of analog and \ndigital dropsonde transducers with a single integrated circuit that takes all required \nmeasurements and sends data to the radio transmitter via a common data bus with the GPS \nlocation data. (The sensor head was shown in Figure 1-2 above.) Total weight is slashed from \n347 g to 199 g while accuracy is enhanced. \nIn addition to the sensor module and GPS receiver modules, the dropsonde electronics board \nincludes a microprocessor to control sensors and send data to the 100 mW, 400 MHz telemetry \ntransmitter. Overall dropsonde arrangement is shown in Figure 2-3. \n \nFigure 2-3. Interior Dropsonde Arrangement. Shown here with parachute deployed, the \ndropsonde uses functional components as its structural framework, reducing total weight. \n \nIn summary, we offer a cost-efficient and highly reliable dropsonde with improved \nmeasurements. It is lighter weight due to our transducer design modifications and composite \nmaterials, and affords production cost savings with our Lean and Six Sigma initiatives. We have \nalso added infrared eye-wall lightning sensing. \nProven ORDP \nIn your RFP, you indicated the current ORDP, the Newmanix DLS-100, still meets your \nrequirements.

Design Approach\nAn easy-to-use streamlined project planning package will be tailored \nby Svensco with other strategic partners to develop country-specific \nestimates within 2 to 5 days. \nUsing the design parameters established in the project orientation workshops and \nproven conceptual design methods, Svensco will team with the other strategic partners \nselected by BuzzKola to choose a common design package and tailor it for BuzzKola \nfacilities. We have used and tailored different design packages and think the choice \nshould be based on the best fit for all of BuzzKola’s partners. \nOur approach to develop the Conceptual Design Package is described in the following \norder:\n3.1\t Conceptual Design Methods—Project planning accuracy depends on a proven \ndesign method and is the basis to structure the project planning package. \n3.2\t Software and Tools—A standard package will be tailored for BuzzKola facilities.\n3.3 \t Schedule—Describes the tasks anticipated with the minimum and maximum \ntimes required to meet the 2- to 5-day target.\n3.4\t Design Input and Design Output—Reviews the level of detail anticipated and \nhow Svensco will compensate if the detail is not available.\n3.1 Conceptual Design Methods\nThe accuracy of each design package requires a sound conceptual design process that \nincorporates the design parameters established in the project orientation workshops. \nFor example, design parameters are used to calculate plant capacity and expansion \noptions from sales volume projections. \nThe Global Project Delivery Flowchart, Figure 3-1, the large foldout on the following \npage, shows the basic process envisioned to estimate and schedule capital projects. To \nimprove estimating accuracy, we pre-define standard steps to adjust for country-specific \nconditions and variables for each project. \nDuring the Programming Phase, some of the variables in the development process \ninclude land rights and leases, taxation issues, laws, custom duties, logistic issues, \ntechnical-economical study documentation, local construction regulations, local \nresources, and other unique requirements.\nFollowing a consistent conceptual design process enables Svensco to produce a credible \nConceptual Design Package in the 2- to 5-working day range required. . . .\n . . .\n . . . \nSections 3.2 through 3.4 were omitted here for brevity.\nBased on the \nworkshop and your \nown expertise, you \nwould be required \nto develop concep-\ntual design methods \nand (software) tools \nto turn around typi-\ncal project inquiries \nin 2-5 working days \nfor the following \nwarehouse/distri-\nbution centers and \nproduction plant \nfacilities.\n12\nThis is the entire RFP design \nrequirement.\n13\nThe informal table of \ncontents roughly matches \nthe RFP excerpt. The \nsubsection headings are \npreviewed along with a \nshort summary sentence. \n14\nThe actual subheading \nmatches the introduction \nprecisely.\n15\nWherever possible, figures \nwere used to shorten \nproposal preparation time \nand emphasize compliance. \nFigures were easier and \nfaster to prepare due to \nthe diverse international \nbackground of the \ncontributors.

Turnkey Bid Package\nBuzzKola’s partners will get a detailed turnkey bid package within 4 weeks based on \nthe conceptual design and modifications using our detailed knowledge of local market \nconditions.\nOn confirmation from BuzzKola that the conceptual design package has been completed \nsuccessfully, we will begin developing the turnkey bid package. In this section, we \ndescribe the contents of the turnkey bid package and detail our approach to develop a \npackage that meets BuzzKola’s requirements to issue the proposal within 4 weeks. \nOur approach to develop the turnkey bid package is described in the following order:\n4.1\t\nContent of the Turnkey Bid Package and Development Tasks\n4.2\t\nAdditional Local Input—required to enhance the Conceptual Design Package to \nmeet the local requirements\n4.3\t\nFurther Value-Added Benefits\n4.4\t\nResponsibility and Risk Sharing—will depend on location and completion time \nrequired\n4.5\t\nOur Approach to Level 2 Countries\n4.6\t\nRestrictions and Limitations\n4.1 Content of the Turnkey Bid Package and Development  \n\t\nTasks\nOur planning of the Turnkey Bid Package begins with a clear definition of the end \nproduct, defining the output or contents of the package. We will then review the input \nthat we would have for each output item and determine what activities we would have \nto complete. These activities will become our development tasks.\nBased on the success-\nful completion of the \nbasic design package \nportion of the pre-\nqualification exercise, \nwe will ask you to put \ntogether the necessary \ntools and procedures \nsuch that you would be \nin a position to develop \na detailed proposal \nin the form of a fixed \nprice, turnkey contract \nfor the complete sup-\nply of the facility to the \nagreed schedule. \nSuccessful Turnkey \nProject in a Develop-\ning Market. Svensco \ncompleted this bever-\nage plant on a turnkey \nbasis, on time and on \nbudget due to careful \nplanning.\nOutputs, inputs, and activities are shown in figure 4-1. The schedule for the \ndevelopment tasks is shown in figure 4-2.\nThe goal of the development tasks is to enable BuzzKola’s strategic partner to \nprepare a detailed proposal with a firm fixed level of detail for any selected country \nand location in the world. We plan to have each relevant Svensco location prepare a \nstart-up plan and materials to enable them to meet your 4-week requirement.\nOur approach leverages our local knowledge and then specifically relates it to the \nBuzzKola facilities requirements to save both time and money to the benefit of all \nparties. As soon as the details are presented from the Project Orientation Workshop, \nour local project teams will begin the development tasks required for execution of a \nBuzzKola facility.

The diagrams on \npages 10 and 11 show how to track \nthrough the levels submitted all the way \nto the detailed cost substantiation which \nis available for your review. \nWe have also placed notes within the \ncost volume to help you track upwards \nor downwards through the volume. \nNotes in the right-hand margin link you \nto pages showing supporting informa-\ntion. Notes at the bottom of pages help \nexplain our assumptions and our \napproach. An example is shown below.\nDirect Engineering\nCost   Element WBS   WP#   Cost\nPage reference:\nSee p. 111-45\nExplanatory note:\nOur Direct Engineering rate not only includes the engineer but \nalso includes drafting assistance, CAD operating and \nmaintenance costs, and document control.\nFigure 9. Summarize Your Costing Approach. Use both text \nand a graphic to summarize your costing approach. Sum-\nmarize and justify any changes in your approach. If you have \ncalculated new labor standards, justify why. For example, one \ncost volume manager justified a high engineering cost per hour \nby noting that all drafting and computer support costs were \nwrapped into the engineering overhead rate.\nFigure 10. Explain Your Cost Volume Organization. Cost \nanalysts are often forced to spend a lot of time just trying \nto figure out how cost volumes are organized. Eliminate \nthis wasted time and improve cost analysts’ evaluation \nperspective by clearly explaining your approach. \nCompany Name                                                                Proposal Name\nCost Volume Summary\nPhase\nSummary of Acquisition Costs\nContract Pricing Proposal\nCover Sheet\nForm 1411\nPhase\nForm 2607\nCost by WBS Element\nForm 2607\nCost Element\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nTotal\nWBS/Organization Responsibility Matrix\nWBS #\nWork Package Numbers\n1111\n1112\n1113\nAvailable upon request in \ncost substantiation \nvolumes.\nWXYZA Work Package\nWXYZA Work Package\nDetailed labor & \nmaterial estimates\nWXYZA, WXYZB, ...\nWXYZB, ...\nCompany Name                                                                Proposal Name\nCost Volume Summary\nCost Volume\nVolume III\nCost \nVolume\nSummary\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\nChapter 2\nDesign\nChapter 3\nDem/Value\nChapter 4\nDevelopment\nChapter 5\nProduction\nChapter 6\nSoftware \nParametric \nData\nChapter 7\nAffordability\nAnalysis\nChapter 8\nLife Cycle \nCost\nNote:\nOur Cost Substantiation Guide and the \nsupporting work packages were not \nsubmitted but are available upon request.\nFigure 11.
