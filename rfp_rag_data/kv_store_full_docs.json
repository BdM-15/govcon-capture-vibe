An allotment schedule is set forth in on individual task orders\nparagraph (j) of this clause.\n(b)For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the  \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract.The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point.The Government will not be   \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\"As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government  \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s).\n(c)Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in  \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s).The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of  \nadditional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds

Contracting Officer will terminate any \nitem(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the \nGovernment.\"\n(d)When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will  \nagree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds.The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will  \napply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute

additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including \nappropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both.Failure to agree to any such equitable  \nadjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \"Disputes.\"\n(f)The

Failure to do so may be cause to \nrender the offer non-responsive. Because the pricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a \ndiscrepancy between the price proposal hard copies and the price proposal electronic copies, the price proposal electronic copies will take \nprecedence.\n       1. Reminder - The proposed ELIN Pricing should be allocated based upon each customer's solicitation requirements. For example, \ncustomers with comparable requirements should be priced similarly. As stated in the Price Evaluation Factor, the Government will evaluate \nthe price proposal for unbalanced pricing, which may be found when line pricing at any level is overstated or understated.\ne. All ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall \nbe calculated based on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the \nGovernment will round the unit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for \nevaluation purposes.\nf.

The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue - the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR \n15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if \nthe Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an \nefficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number \nthat will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.\n3. The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor. \nPage 61 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(a) Price:\n1. Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(a) Provide a completed Section B of the solicitation.\n(b) Provide a completed Section J Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Pricing Attachment. There are multiple worksheets within this file that require \ncompletion.  \n(c) Submit pricing data (Section B and Section J ELINs) in hard copy and in electronic (Microsoft Office Version 365 compatible) format on CD-\nROM. Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Analysis will be \nperformed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:\n(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.\n(ii) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGE.\n(iii) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.\n(iv) Comparison of market survey results.\n(v) And/or any other methodology deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer and consistent with FAR 15.404-1.\nb. The Government will evaluate the price proposal for unbalanced pricing, and may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed \nare materially unbalanced and represent an unacceptable risk to the government. In general, unbalanced pricing may be found when, despite an \nacceptable total evaluated price, line pricing at any level, between functional annexes/sub-annexes, periods of performance, type of work, or otherwise \nmay be relatively and significantly overstated or understated.\nc. The Government will evaluate the proposal for any inconsistent pricing submitted within Section B and the Section J ELIN attachment, and correct \nany discrepancies in accordance with Section M.3 of the solicitation, or through clarifications, discussions or other means consistent with applicable \nregulations. \n(b) Non-cost/price Factors:\nThe offeror's response to factors that require the submission of Corporate Experience and Past Performance shall be based on the following relevancy \ndefinition:\nRELEVANT PROJECT:  Relevant projects include those that demonstrate the capability to perform services similar in size, scope, and complexity \nto those described in the performance work statement/specifications of the RFP with a contract value of $15,000,000.00 per year or greater that is \neither: 1) ongoing with at least 12 months of contract performance completed by the date of receipt of initial proposals, or 2) completed within the last \nfive (5) years of date of receipt of initial proposals. For purposes of this evaluation, Base Operations Support (BOS) services (or equivalent) projects \nshall encompass at least three of the following and a minimum of one other technical annex/sub-annex as part of the scope of work (see Factor 3 for a \nlist of annexes/sub-annexes):\na. 0600000 - Port Operations (similar to the requirements of this RFP)\nb. 1502000 - Facility Investment (at minimum, including the completion of service orders, HVAC Systems maintenance and repairs, Fire Protection \nSystems maintenance and repairs, and two other facility investment spec items identified in the RFP).\nc. 1602000 - Electrical similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Transmission & Distributions operations, maintenance and repairs).\nd. 1606000 - Water similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Raw Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant and Distribution System \noperation, Laboratory and Testing processes, maintenance and repairs).\ne. 1700000 - BSVE (at minimum, including operations, maintenance and repair of Civil Engineering Support Equipment (CESE) and Weight \nHandling Equipment (WHE) similar to the requirements of this RFP).\nAnnexes 0100000 - General Information and 0200000 - Management and Administration will not be considered towards the minimum of one other \ntechnical annex/sub-annex requirement to demonstrate a relevant project.\nPage 62 of 71\nN6945025R0003\nComplexity will be determined based on the projects' contract type, facilities maintained (size, quantity and type), systems maintained (quantities and \ncapacities), and program structure (combination of Preventive Maintenance (PM) Program, E/U/R work orders or service orders, Integrated \nMaintenance Program (IMP), other recurring services).\n(1) Factor 1, Corporate Experience:\n(a). Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nThe offeror shall submit a minimum of two (2) to a maximum of five (5) examples of recent, relevant projects that the offeror (including joint \nventures and partnerships) completed and served as the prime contractor.

JV offerors are still limited to a total of five (5) recent and relevant projects.\nIf a project was performed by a JV, and not all partners from the prior JV are proposing on this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly demonstrate what \nportion of the work on the submitted project was performed by the JV partner offering on this solicitation. If the offeror does not specifically address \nwhat portion of the work under the submitted project was performed by the JV partner offering on this contract, the project will not be considered \nrelevant.\nAn offeror may rely on the prime contractor experience or corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies, and parent \ncompanies) to demonstrate experience, provided the offeror submits all of the following:\n(i) A one-page narrative clearly demonstrating that the corporate affiliates will have meaningful participation in the project by identifying the \npersonnel or resources from the corporate affiliates that will be dedicated to the project;\n(ii) An organization chart that demonstrates the corporate relationship of the affiliates, and\n(iii) Teaming Agreement/letter of commitment\n(a) Basis of Evaluation.\nThe assessment of the offeror's recent and relevant experience will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the offeror to successfully meet \nthe requirements of this solicitation. The Government will consider the depth and breadth of the relevant experience, focusing on performance of \ntechnical specifications to be performed under this contract, to evaluate the level of risk of unsuccessful performance. The Government will review \nonly five (5) projects. Any projects submitted in excess of the five (5) project limit will not be considered.\nOfferors who fail to submit a minimum of two (2) examples of recent, relevant projects that the offeror (including joint ventures and partnerships) \ncompleted and served as the prime contractor will be considered unacceptable.\nOfferors who fail to demonstrate relevant experience in one or more of the following annexes/sub-annexes will be considered unacceptable:\n(a) 0600000 - Port Operations (similar to the requirements of this RFP);\n(b) 1502000 - Facility Investment similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, including the completion of E/U/R work orders or service \norders, HVAC Systems maintenance and repairs, Fire Protection Systems maintenance and repairs, and two other facility investment spec items \nidentified in the RFP);\n(c) 1602000 - Electrical similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Transmission & Distributions operations, maintenance and repairs);\n(d) 1606000 - Water similar to the requirements of the RFP (at minimum, Raw Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant and Distribution System \noperation, Laboratory and Testing processes, maintenance and repairs);\n(e) 1700000 - BSVE (at minimum, including operations, maintenance and repair of CESE and WHE similar to the requirements of this RFP);\nPage 63 of 71\nN6945025R0003\nOfferors who demonstrate relevant project experience in any of the remaining technical annexes/sub-annexes may be evaluated more favorably.\nProjects completed by the offeror or its corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies and parent companies) in any \ncapacity other than as prime contractor will be considered not relevant.\nProjects completed by a proposed subcontractor will be considered not relevant.\nProjects submitted by JVs where the JV partners performed together may be evaluated more favorably than projects in which the JV partners did not \nperform together.\nWith the exception of offerors covered by Mentor-Protege Agreements approved by the Small Business Administration, if the offeror is a JV, each \nmember of the JV must demonstrate prime contractor experience on at least one relevant project. If each member of the JV does not have at least one \nrelevant experience project, then the offeror will be considered unacceptable.\nOfferors who demonstrate experience without relying on corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, sister companies, predecessor companies and parent \ncompanies) may be evaluated more favorably.\nFor multiple award contracts (MACs) or indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, the specific relevant task order, not the entire MAC \nor IDIQ contract, will be considered a project for evaluation purposes.\n(2) Factor 2, Management Approach:\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nThe offeror shall clearly demonstrate a feasible approach for controlling and managing the entire project, including the interface between the major \nfunctional areas and sub-annexes, and the offeror's general management and administration structure.

For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In this case, the offeror's past \nperformance is unknown and assigned a confidence rating of \"neutral.\"\nFAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference\nNumber Title Effective \nDate\nAlternate/\nDeviation\nVariation\nEffective\nDate\n52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.

For this/these item(s), the sum of $ \n \nto be specified on individual task orders \nto be specified \n of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in \non individual task orders\nparagraph (j) of this clause.\n(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the \n \nGovernment, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount \ncurrently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be \n \n \nobligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the \ncontrary in the clause entitled \"Termination for Convenience of the Government.\" As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government \n \nin the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for \nthose item(s).\n(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in \n \nwriting at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable \nby the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract \nfor performance of the applicable item(s).

The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue - the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR \n15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if \nthe Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an \nefficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number \nthat will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.\n3. The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor. \nPage 61 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n(a) Price:\n1. Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(a) Provide a completed Section B of the solicitation.\n(b) Provide a completed Section J Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN) Pricing Attachment. There are multiple worksheets within this file that require \ncompletion.  \n(c) Submit pricing data (Section B and Section J ELINs) in hard copy and in electronic (Microsoft Office Version 365 compatible) format on CD-\nROM. Offerors shall utilize the pricing attachments provided in Section J to submit the Section B and ELIN data in the format provided. Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Analysis will be \nperformed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:\n(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.\n(ii) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGE.\n(iii) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.\n(iv) Comparison of market survey results.\n(v) And/or any other methodology deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer and consistent with FAR 15.404-1.\nb. The Government will evaluate the price proposal for unbalanced pricing, and may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed \nare materially unbalanced and represent an unacceptable risk to the government.

Should a negative trend occur above moderate risk \nlevels, an acceptable/detailed explanation is required that includes any corrective actions taken for improvement.\n(1) TCR cases include injuries or illnesses resulting in death, days away from work, restricted work or transfer to another job days beyond the day of \ninjury/illness, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.\n(2) Calculation of TCR rate: Multiply the total number of TCR incidents by 200,000, and then divide by the number of employee labor hours worked.\nTCR RATE=(Number of TCR Incidents x 200,000)/(Total Number of Employee Labor Hours Worked)\n(iii) Technical Approach to Safety: Submit a narrative that addresses the following:\nPage 68 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n1.  \n(1) Describe the offeror' s approach to implementing and executing a Safety Management System (SMS) including Management/Leadership \ninvolvement, Employee involvement, Hazard prevention, Hazard control, Worksite analysis, and Safety and health training, to include the standard(s) \nused to benchmark the SMS.\n(2) Describe the evaluation process used to select potential subcontractors.\n(3) Describe the processes of how the offeror will oversee safety compliance of subcontractors at all levels throughout performance of the contract (to \ninclude the offeror's own in-house workforce).\n(4) The Technical Approach to Safety narrative shall be limited to two (2) single-sided pages or one (1) double-sided page.\n(iv) The Government reserves the right to review other available sources (public/Government internal) of information. These may include but are not \nlimited to OSHA data, NAVFAC's Contractor Incident Reporting System (CIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), \nElectronic Contract Management System (eCMS), etc.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation.\nThe Government is seeking to determine that the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the offeror plans to properly \nmanage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The evaluation will collectively consider the DART rate, TCR, Technical \nApproach to Safety, and other sources of information available to the Government as part of such collective evaluation. The board will evaluate the \nDART rates and TCR to determine if the offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any negative trends and \nextenuating circumstances that impact the rating.\n(i) DART Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one risk level (or more) to the next up or \ndown. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the offeror to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions \ntaken for improvement.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing DART rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate.\n(4) This chart correlates the DART rate to the level of risk:\nRisk\nDART Rate\nVery Low Risk\nLess Than 1.0\nLow Risk\nFrom 1.0 to 1.99\nModerate Risk\nFrom 2.0 to 2.99\nHigh Risk\nFrom 3.0 to 4.0\nExtremely High Risk Greater than 4.0\n(ii) TCR Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one \nrisk level (or more) to the next up or down. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the \nofferor to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions taken for improvement.\n1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue--the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing TCR rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate\nThis chart correlates the TCR rate to the level of risk:\nRisk\nTCR Rate\nVery Low Risk\nLess Than 2.49\nLow Risk\nFrom 2.5 to 3.49\nModerate Risk\nFrom 3.5 to 4.49\nHigh Risk\nFrom 4.5 to 5.99\nPage 69 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\nExtremely High Risk Greater than 6.0\n(iii) The Technical Approach to Safety Narrative. To determine the degree to which the offeror:\n(1) Describes a viable SMS that addresses elements; such as Management/Leadership involvement, Employee involvement, Hazard prevention, \nHazard control, Worksite analysis, and Safety and health training, to include the standard(s) used to benchmark the SMS.\n(2) Describes a methodical process of evaluating subcontractor's safety performance in their selection process.\n(3) Describes a logical management plan to hold themselves and their subcontractors accountable for adhering to the safety requirements of the \ncontract.\n(4) The Technical Approach to Safety narrative shall be limited to two (2) single-sided pages or one (1) double-sided page. Information on pages \nbeyond this will not be considered.\n(iv) The Government reserves the right to review other available sources (public/Government internal) of information. These may include but are not \nlimited to OSHA data, NAVFAC's Contractor Incident Reporting System (CIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), \nElectronic Contract Management System (eCMS), etc.\n(v) Any contractor job-related mishap death within the past five years may be assigned an unacceptable safety factor rating. Any fatalities experienced \nwithin this 5-year timeframe must be explained in detail, to include root cause and corrective actions.\n(6) Factor 6, Past Performance:\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nFOR EACH PROJECT IDENTIFIED IN RESPONSE TO FACTOR 1, IF A COMPLETED CPARS EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE, IT SHALL \nBE SUBMITTED WITH THE PROPOSAL. If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in \nthe solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS IS AVAILABLE.\n(ii) If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed \nPPQs should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing \ndate, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Attachment D), which will provide contract and client \ninformation for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client \nrequests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Courtney Peterson or Cari Fiebach via email at courtney.j.\npeterson3.civ@us.navy.mil or cari.l.fiebach.civ@us.navy.mil prior to proposal closing date. Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their \nproposal PPQs or CPARS previously submitted for other RFPs. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted \nPPQ information in the past performance evaluation.\n(iii) Also, include performance recognition documents received within the last five (5) years such as awards, award fee determinations, customer \nletters of commendation, and any other forms of performance recognition. \n(iv) Sources of Past Performance Information for evaluation that may be used are as follows: \nPast performance information provided by the offeror, as solicited;\nPast performance information obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition; and\nPast performance information obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, Contractor Performance \nAssessment Reporting System (CPARS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract \nReporting System (eSRS), or other databases; the Defense Contract Management Agency; and interviews with Program Managers, Contracting \nOfficers, and Fee Determining Officials.\n(v) While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past \nperformance information rests with the offeror.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation: The Government will evaluate how well the offeror performed on the recent, relevant projects submitted under Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience, and on other recent, relevant contracts documented in known sources. There are three aspects of the past performance \nevaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. The first is to evaluate the recency of the offeror's past performance. The second aspect is to determine the \nrelevancy of the offeror's past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\n\nN6945025R0003\n(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In this case, the offeror's past \nperformance is unknown and assigned a confidence rating of \"neutral.\"\nFAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference\nNumber\nTitle\nEffective \nDate\nAlternate/\nDeviation\nVariation\nEffective\nDate\n52.217-5\nEvaluation of Options.\nJul 1990\nPage 71 of 71",
