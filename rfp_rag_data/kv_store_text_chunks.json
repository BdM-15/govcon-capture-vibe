The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue - the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR \n15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if \nthe Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an \nefficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number \nthat will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.\n3. The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of \naward to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\n4. All technical factors when combined are of equal importance to the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating; and all technical \nfactors and the performance confidence assessment (past performance) rating, when combined are significantly more important than price.\n5. Any proposal found to have a deficiency in meeting the stated solicitation requirements or performance objectives will be considered ineligible for \naward, unless the deficiency is corrected through discussions. Proposals may be found to have either a significant weakness or multiple weaknesses \nthat impact either the individual factor rating or the overall rating for the proposal. \nM.2 ELIN/SUB-ELIN PRICES\nAll ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices shall be rounded to two (2) decimal places, and the extended total price for each ELIN/Sub-ELIN shall be calculated \nbased on the rounded unit price. If the offeror does not round ELIN/Sub-ELIN unit prices to two (2) decimal places, the Government will round the \nunit prices to two (2) decimal places and the total of the ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly for evaluation purposes.\nM.3 PRICING DISCREPANCIES\nIn the event there is a difference between the unit prices and extended total amounts, the unit price will be held to be the intended offer and total of the \nCLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN will be recomputed accordingly. The CLIN which includes the recomputed ELIN/Sub-ELIN will also be recomputed to \ntake into account the change in the ELIN/Sub-ELIN.\nIf the offeror provides a total amount for a CLIN or ELIN/Sub-ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the CLIN/ELIN/Sub-\nELIN quantity will be held to be the intended unit price. \nIn the event there is a discrepancy between the Section J ELIN pricing and the Section B CLIN price, the Section J ELIN pricing will be held to be the \nintended offer.\nM.4 EVALUATION FACTORS\n1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-cost/price factors.\nFactor 1 - Corporate Experience \nFactor 2 - Management Approach\nFactor 3 - Technical Approach\nFactor 4 - Small Business Utilization\nFactor 5 - Safety \nFactor 6 - Past Performance\nThe distinction between corporate experience and past performance is corporate experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work \ncompleted by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past \nperformance pertains to both the relevance of recent efforts and how well a contractor has performed on the contracts. \n2. The relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance to each \nother and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor 6. When the \nproposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost\n/price evaluation factors) are significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if the Offerors' non-cost/price proposals \nare considered essentially equal in terms of overall quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a non-cost/price proposal's \nsuperiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best \nvalue to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.\n3.

Because the \npricing evaluation will concentrate on the electronic files submitted, in the event of a discrepancy between the proposal hard copies and the proposal \nelectronic copies, the proposal electronic copies will take precedence.\n2. Basis of Evaluation:\na. The Government will evaluate price based on the total price. Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items (see Section B of \nthe solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate all options and has included the provision FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) in \nthe solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Analysis will be \nperformed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:\n(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.\n(ii) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGE.\n(iii) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.\n(iv) Comparison of market survey results.\n(v) And/or any other methodology deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer and consistent with FAR 15.404-1.\nb. The Government will evaluate the price proposal for unbalanced pricing, and may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed \nare materially unbalanced and represent an unacceptable risk to the government.

The offeror is required to demonstrate its previous commitment to SBs through its record of past utilization of SBs and its \nplanned level of commitment to small business if awarded a contract under this solicitation.\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\n(i) All Offerors (large, non-profits, AND small businesses) shall use Attachment JM-2 (Historical Small Business Utilization) to demonstrate their \nhistorical utilization of SBs. Each project submitted under Factor 1, Corporate Experience, shall be included on Attachment  Failure to include JM-2.\neach project submitted under Factor 1, Corporate Experience, on Attachment , or the failure to fully complete Attachment  for each JM-2  JM-2 \nproject may result in a deficiency. Only complete Attachment  Information provided in a different format and/or on a form created by the JM-2. \nofferor will not be evaluated. Attachments or addendums to Attachment  will not be evaluated. Offerors are permitted to expand portions of the JM-2 \nform, as needed, to provide sufficient response. Instructions regarding how to complete Attachment  are included at the beginning of the JM-2 \nattachment.\n(ii) All offerors (large, non-profits, AND small businesses) shall use Attachment JM-3 (Small Business Participation Commitment Document \n(SBPCD)) to submit the following required information for evaluation of this factor:\nTo demonstrate commitment to use small business concerns in the performance of this contract, identify by name the subcontractors that will be used \nto support each small business category, including SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, VOSB, and SDVOSBs. Identify the type and complexity of product\n/service to be subcontracted, and the type of commitment (i.e., teaming agreement, joint venture agreement, mentor protege agreement, letter of \ncommitment, etc.) with each subcontractor. \nIf subcontractors are not identified by name, offerors shall provide a detailed explanation why subcontractors are not identified. If firm written \ncommitments with SBs are not in place, offerors shall provide an explanation and rationale on the ability to achieve the proposed participation. (See \nAttachment JM-3, paragraph 5)\nIf a LB offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance. \nSBs intending to 100% self-perform are not required to provide an explanation. (See Attachment JM-3, paragraph 6) To demonstrate maximum \npracticable participation of small businesses, identify (in terms of dollar value and ) the offeror's proposed small percentage of the total contract value\nbusiness participation. The minimum required small business participation (i.e. work to be performed by small business as the prime contractor and/or \nwork to be performed by small business subcontractors) is 20%. Offerors who are not able to meet the minimum total small business participation \nrequirement of 20% (of the total contract value) shall provide a detailed explanation why the minimum total small business participation requirement \ncannot be achieved.\nOnly complete Attachment JM-3. Information provided in a different format and/or on a form created by the offeror will not be evaluated. \nAttachments or addendums to Attachment JM-3 will not be evaluated.\nLarge business offerors may achieve the minimum total small business participation requirement through subcontracting to small businesses.\nSmall business offerors may achieve the minimum total small business participation requirement through their own performance/participation as a \nprime as well as through a joint venture, teaming arrangement, and/or subcontracting with other small business concerns.\nPage 67 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(b) Basis of Evaluation:\nThe Government will evaluate the realism and likelihood of success in achieving the small business objectives of this acquisition based on the \nfollowing:\n(i) The extent to which the offeror is able to demonstrate a history of supporting Government policies concerning the utilization of small business \nconcerns, including SDB, W",

For projects submitted for Factor 1, Corporate Experience, that did not have established small business goals, consideration will be \ngiven to the utilization of the small business concerns and the degree of usage of small business relative to the total contract value. Historical Small \nBusiness Utilization will only be evaluated if performed by the offeror.\n(ii) The extent to which the offeror has demonstrated an achievable commitment to use small businesses, including SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, \nVOSB, and SDVOSB in the performance of this contract within the SBPCD. \nThe minimum small business participation requirement, through work performed by the small business prime and/or subcontracting with small \nbusinesses, shall meet or exceed 20% of the total contract value, unless the offeror provides a reasonable and well-documented explanation for why \nthe minimum 20% small business participation requirement cannot be achieved.\nOfferors that demonstrate a commitment to providing maximum practical opportunity to small businesses may be rated higher.\nProposing less than 20% total small business participation requirement may result in a deficiency.\nOfferors that do not demonstrate commitment to providing maximum practical opportunity to small businesses may result in a deficiency.\nThe SBPCD will be evaluated to determine the extent to which small business concerns are specifically identified by name and socioeconomic \ncategory in the document and the degree to which small business concerns, including SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, VOSB, and SDVOSB will \nparticipate relative to the total contract value. The complexity and variety of the work small business concerns will perform and the degree of \ncommitment to use named sources through formal teaming agreements, joint venture agreements, mentor protege agreements, written/signed letters of \n/commitment, etc. will be evaluated to assess achievability of the commitment.\nThe offeror may receive a deficiency if firm commitments with subcontractors are not provided and the offeror fails to provide a detailed explanation \nfor how the proposed small business participation requirement will be achieved.\nThe offeror may be rated lower, if they fail to provide a detailed explanation for why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract \nperformance.

These may include but are not \nlimited to OSHA data, NAVFAC's Contractor Incident Reporting System (CIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), \nElectronic Contract Management System (eCMS), etc.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation.\nThe Government is seeking to determine that the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the offeror plans to properly \nmanage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The evaluation will collectively consider the DART rate, TCR, Technical \nApproach to Safety, and other sources of information available to the Government as part of such collective evaluation. The board will evaluate the \nDART rates and TCR to determine if the offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any negative trends and \nextenuating circumstances that impact the rating.\n(i) DART Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one risk level (or more) to the next up or \ndown. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the offeror to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions \ntaken for improvement.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing DART rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate.\n(4) This chart correlates the DART rate to the level of risk:\nRisk DART Rate\nVery Low Risk Less Than 1.0\nLow Risk From 1.0 to 1.99\nModerate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99\nHigh Risk From 3.0 to 4.0\nExtremely High RiskGreater than 4.0\n(ii) TCR Rate: The board will evaluate trends over the last five years considering changes that take it from one \nrisk level (or more) to the next up or down. Negative trends occurring above moderate risk levels require the \nofferor to provide a detailed explanation that includes any corrective actions taken for improvement.\n1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to \nnegotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the proposal determined to represent the best \nvalue--the proposal most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered.\n(1) Missing data without an explanation is considered a deficiency.\n(2) Declining trends that push the risk levels from Moderate Risk (MR) or higher to Low Risk (LR) or Very Low Risk (VLR) would indicate a \nstrength.\n(3) An increasing TCR rate trend could be considered a weakness (i.e. MR or better to High Risk (HR) or Extremely High Risk EHR)) if an \nacceptable explanation is not provided for any trends that rise above Moderate\nThis chart correlates the TCR rate to the level of risk:\nRisk TCR Rate\nVery Low Risk Less Than 2.49\nLow Risk From 2.5 to 3.49\nModerate Risk From 3.5 to 4.49\nHigh Risk From 4.5 to 5.99\nPage 69 of 71\nN6945025R0003\nExtremely High RiskGreater than 6.0\n(iii) The Technical Approach to Safety Narrative.

Any fatalities experienced \nwithin this 5-year timeframe must be explained in detail, to include root cause and corrective actions.\n(6) Factor 6, Past Performance:\n(a) Solicitation Submittal Requirements:\nFOR EACH PROJECT IDENTIFIED IN RESPONSE TO FACTOR 1, IF A COMPLETED CPARS EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE, IT SHALL \nBE SUBMITTED WITH THE PROPOSAL. If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in \nthe solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS IS AVAILABLE.\n(ii) If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed \nPPQs should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing \ndate, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Attachment D), which will provide contract and client \ninformation for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client \nrequests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Courtney Peterson or Cari Fiebach via email at courtney.j.\npeterson3.civ@us.navy.mil or cari.l.fiebach.civ@us.navy.mil prior to proposal closing date. Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their \nproposal PPQs or CPARS previously submitted for other RFPs. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted \nPPQ information in the past performance evaluation.\n(iii) Also, include performance recognition documents received within the last five (5) years such as awards, award fee determinations, customer \nletters of commendation, and any other forms of performance recognition. \n(iv) Sources of Past Performance Information for evaluation that may be used are as follows: \nPast performance information provided by the offeror, as solicited;\nPast performance information obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition; and\nPast performance information obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, Contractor Performance \nAssessment Reporting System (CPARS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract \nReporting System (eSRS), or other databases; the Defense Contract Management Agency; and interviews with Program Managers, Contracting \nOfficers, and Fee Determining Officials.\n(v) While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past \nperformance information rests with the offeror.\n(b) Basis of Evaluation: The Government will evaluate how well the offeror performed on the recent, relevant projects submitted under Factor 1, \nCorporate Experience, and on other recent, relevant contracts documented in known sources. There are three aspects of the past performance \nevaluation: recency, relevancy, and quality. The first is to evaluate the recency of the offeror's past performance. The second aspect is to determine the \nrelevancy of the offeror's past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, the criteria identified in Factor 1, Corporate Experience will be utilized in \ndetermining relevancy. The third aspect is to evaluate the overall quality of the offeror's past performance and how well the offeror performed on the \nprojects. The past performance evaluation does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on \npast contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed on those past \ncontracts. \nThe Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the \nGovernment (e.g., CPARS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System \n(eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:\n(i) A pattern of successful completion of tasks;\n(ii) A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;\n(iii) A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); and\nPage 70 of 71\nN6945025R0003\n(iv) Recency/relevancy (as defined in Factor 1) of tasks performed that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand.\nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past contract performance is not available, the \nofferor may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv).
